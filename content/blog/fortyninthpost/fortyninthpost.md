                    This is my review of Volume 24 of Nisekoi and this is the penultimate volume of the series. Only Kosaki and Chitoge left in the running for Raku's heart, so who will win and who do you want to win. Answers will be given next time which will be next week as I will be on holiday from the end of next week to until the first weekend of July.

                    Ruri communicates with her as she can speak english. They find out the lost child’s name is Rosa and she doesn’t know where her parents are. There aren’t any police boxes nearby, so it is going up to them to find her parents. Shu takes a shine to Rosa and snaps some pictures of her, so Ruri to ask what he would do if Rosa was a boy and Shu responds that he wouldn’t help. Ruri begins to leave with Rosa, assuming that Shu is being serious, while Shu explains that he was joking (we were all laughing at that joke, weren’t we).<br/>
                    Ruri is unsure about 2 things: one, why she asked Shu if he was still in love with Ms Kyoko and two, where they should start looking for Rosa’s parents. Shu has an answer for one of those and he suggests they start looking around the local tourist spots and if that fails, heading to the local police station. They head to a tourist spot and Ruri ask if Rosa recognises it, but she doesn’t and begins to fear the she has been abandoned by her parents. Ruri attempts to calm her down but has no luck, although Shu fares better when he hands Rosa a Japan-exclusive Mr Moppy. Shu also hands her some Kusamochi (a green, gelatinous rice cake) which is also a hit and these decisions were based off the facts that Rosa has a Mr Moppy pin on her purse and she kept on looking shop window as they walked to this spot, which impresses Ruri as she didn’t spot it herself. As Rosa doesn’t recognise this area, Shu suggests that they visit somewhere else and points to a tower in the distance, which Rosa recognises. Ruri asks why Shu knows where to go and Shu reveals that those pictures that he took of Rosa earlier were sent to a private forum of which one of its members works at the hotel that Rosa is staying at. This impresses as well as creeps out Ruri, but she admits that is something she could never do. Ruri confesses that she understands why Raku relies on Shu, but he corrects her and explains that he relies on him as Raku is who is aspires to be as he believes that Raku is not wasting his youth (debatable) and gives an example of where Raku rushed to save someone while he did nothing. Shu asks Ruri not to tell anyone (especially Raku), which makes Ruri think as to why he is constantly telling her such personal thoughts so she asks why he is.

                    Shu explains that he thinks that he and Ruri are alike in a way and, much to his surprise, Ruri accepts the explanation. They all continue to look, during which Rosa remarks that Shu and Ruri remind her of her parents as they are so close with one another. Ruri strongly refutes this and dismisses the notion that she likes Shu. Internally, Ruri admits the she has new opinion of Shu but then he spots 2 'mega-babes' and announces it, which annoys Ruri enough for her snap and accuse him never having sincere feelings for Ms Kyoko as well as being incapable of having such feelings. Ruri immediately regrets her accusation, but Shu takes a hint and leaves her and Rosa alone. Rosa asks what has exactly has happened (she has worked out that they were arguing) and Ruri explains that she has been mean to Shu and Rosa should never say mean things to people she loves. Ruri then asks why Rosa thought that Ruri was in love with Shu and Rosa responds that she has been looking at him the whole time they were together. Rosa then spots her parents and runs towards them, but she crosses in front of a car. Luckily, the car doesn’t hit her as Shu comes out of nowhere to move Rosa to safety. Ruri realises that she is in love with problematic guy.

                    The memory from over 10 years ago about Raku’s pendant and the promise made over it (the Chekov’s gun that has been the main plot driver of this series) is the focus of Raku’s dream. Raku explains the situation he is romantically in right now, while the main topic of conversation between his friends is the upcoming meteor shower that they intend to view. Shu has managed to procure a top-line astronomical telescope and while the girls are practising with it, he takes Raku to one side to explain the legend surrounding this meteor shower - any love confession made whilst viewing it is guaranteed to succeed. Raku knows this as it was all over the news. Of course, Shu and Raku aren’t the ones of their friend group who have watched the news, as both Chitoge and Kosaki have decided to confess their love for Raku snd Raku respectively. Meanwhile Shu reminds Raku that his free time with Chitoge is running out rapidly, as she leaves for America when she graduates and they have university entrance exams that will take up the autumn and winter, so he needs to make decision on which girl to go for and besides if one rejects him, he has a back-up. Raku disagrees with the concept that he has a back-up and resolves that if the one he wants rejects him, he isn’t asking the other one out.<br/>
                    The day for the stargazing arrives and Chitoge, Kosaki and Raku are at the school early with the latter’s excuse being to help look after the school’ animals. He gets the others to help, but both are too distracted to be of any use. Before he can pry into as why, it begins to rain as a typhoon that was supposed to miss Japan has suddenly changed course and has made landfall so it is not safe to go outside, so the three are stuck at the school.

                    Kosaki and Chitoge are disappointed that the weather is no longer perfect for a love confession and Raku notices that the 2 are upset, so cheers them up by getting out the picnic food, which has tailored to suit both girls' tastes. The group reminisce about their time at school and Chitoge also takes the time to thank Raku and Kosaki for their company as well as making her high school experience the complete opposite from her middle school experience. The topic of conversation moves to the fact that they aren't stargazing which makes them realise that the telescope is still on the roof. 
                    They all head up to get it, with Raku instructing Kosaki to stay back to not hurt herself, but she slips and Raku cushions her fall although he is knocked out in the process. The telescope is brought inside and Chitoge heads to the nurse's office to get first aid equipment (Raku isn't bleeding by the way), leaving Raku in Kosaki's care. Kosaki blames herself for Raku's unconsciousness and wonders how Raku will react if she were to confess her feelings. Meanwhile, Chitoge has decided that she is going to confess her feelings on the way home with Raku, but a flash of lightning and a power-cut scares her so she heads back to Kosaki and Raku. Meanwhile Kosaki notices that is quiet outside and opens the door to the roof see a beautiful starry night sky (they're in the eye of the storm) and takes the moment to confess her feelings to an unconscious Raku. Chitoge overhears.

                    Kosaki spots Chitoge and asks if she overheard what she said and Chitoge denies that she did. Kosaki mentions that the stars are out, but when Chitoge goes to look it is raining as the typhoon moves on. Chitoge is now grappling with an internal dilemma: support her best friend who has been in love with same guy longer than you or confess your own feelings. She decides to confess, but overhears Raku and Shu talking about Raku's time stargazing and Shu mentions that Raku was unconscious at the feet of his crush. Chitoge continues to listen and finds out that Raku has loved Kosaki since middle school and concludes that she would have never stood a chance. 
                    The next day, Chitoge asks Raku to walk home with her and on this walk Chitoge orders Raku to appreciate Kosaki more and he should treat her more like a lady. Raku understands this as he has not being treating Kosaki right, but Chitoge assures that he has been treating her right. The 2 part ways and the next day at school, Chitoge doesn't appear.

                    On the way to school, Seishiro calls out to Raku to let him know that Chitoge is missing. This is further discussed at school with everyone else, but nobody saw this coming and thus has no concrete idea where she is. Yui comes over to them with a leave of absence form that Chitoge has filled in and Yui can't contact Chitoge (neither can anyone else) and her father isn't forthcoming with an details regarding his daughter whereabouts. Seishiro leaves to go look for Chitoge. After school, Raku visits Chitoge's house to find more out and is greeted by panicked members of the Beehive Gang. The only one who isn't panicking is Adelt (Chitoge's father), who doesn't know where his daughter but expects to find out in few days time. He does know that she is okay and gives Raku an ominous warning that Chitoge may never return to Bonyari. Raku gets access to Chitoge's bedroom to see if he can find any more clues and discovers a notebook that Chitoge has been using as a diary. He reads through it, reminiscing all the events that Chitoge has documented and is upset that Chitoge didn't tell anyone that she was disappearing, especially him. 
                    The next day is the final day before the summer holidays andRuri and Shu agree to start looking after the closing ceremony, while Kosaki and Raku decide to skip the ceremony.

                    Raku and Kosaki excuse themselves and head to the school roof and both express surprise that they are now truant. Kosaki wants to talk about Chitoge as she blames herself for not noticing that something was wrong. Raku assures that she blames herself too much and then Kosaki moves onto what Chitoge said to him on that day. Raku repeats what Chitoge said to him, which connects the dots for Kosaki she realises that Chitoge is in love with Raku and did overhear her confession of love, so has probably run away to allow herself and Raku to be together.Adelt calls Raku to let him know where Chitoge is.<br/>
                    Meanwhile, Chitoge is working as her mother's assistant in her New York office and is impressing everyone with her speed and ability to do the work set for her. Chitoge is still unsure about what to do next but as she is working, her mother is willing to look after her and give her the time she needs to make a decision. Chitoge has decided to move forward and not be in Raku and Kosaki's way towards happiness, but still has feelings for Raku and wishes she was strong as Marika to barge in and try and take Raku. (I swear Marika does more haunting in this series after her departure than Julius Caesar does in Shakespeare's play about him)<br/>
                    <i>In Chitoge's defence, by the time she was in love with Raku, she was also friends with Kosaki and winning Raku's heart comes at the cost of her relationship with her first proper best friend. Chitoge is also someone who doesn't like betrayal, as often the violence she inflicts against Raku is because he is caught 'flirting' with another girl, so it stands to reason that she would not betray a close friend just to get what she wants. With regards to Marika, she was never friends with Kosaki to begin with, so if she takes Raku, then the relationship between her and Kosaki is not damaged, because there were never such closeness to begin with - name a scene where Kosaki and Marika have some time alone.</i><br/>
                    As she is getting her mother some coffee, Chitoge spots Raku and Kosaki.

                    Raku and Kosaki have only one day in New York, but Chitoge is determined to hide from them and goes on a break to hide in the city. Hana greets her daughter's guests but tell them nothing about Chitoge, meaning Chitoge doesn't need to worry that she is being pursued. She decides to spend the rest of the day in New York and is relaxing in a cafe, but overhears Raku Kosaki talking as he are in the same cafe. The bad luck coincidences continue as anywhere Chitoge goes to, Raku and Kosaki are not to far behind. Chitoge escapes to well-known secluded spot in New York, Battery Park on Liberty Island, but Raku and Kosaki are also there and actually spot her. Chitoge runs away and the 2 chase her, but she hides behind a post to lose Raku, but Kosaki's slowness means that when Chitoge emerges from her hiding spot she is right in front of Kosaki. Chitoge runs off again and knowing that she can't catch her, Kosaki shouts at Chitoge telling her that she likes Raku and that Chitoge shouldn't run away.<br/>
                    Back at the office, Chitoge is looking at her key, when Hana (her mother) enters. After explaining the story behind the key, Hana reveals that the author of that book was Raku's mother.

                    Hana reveals that she and Raku's mother were classmates as well as Kosaki's and Marika's mothers and the picture book that inspired the pendant and its promise was given to the Kirisaki family by the Raku's mother. This set of new information causes Chitoge to hope that she is Raku's promise girl (ignore the fact that pretty much everyone had given up on working it out), but she brings herself back to reality as she knows the book was in Kosaki's possession not hers. Hana asks if Chitoge wants to meet Raku's mother and she agrees.<br/>
                    Meanwhile in Japan, Raku and Kosaki are bummed out that didn't find Chitoge in New York, while Kosaki is frustrated that Chitoge has taken action regarding them both being in love with same guy and not consulting her about it. She decides to wait to see if Chitoge will return and if not, then Raku is fair game. She parts ways with Raku, assuring him that she isn't going anywhere.<br/>
                    Chitoge has now arrived at Raku's mother's current residence and is warmly greeted by Raku's mother (get used to this, we don't know her name nor her face). Raku's mother explains that the book that Chitoge came to ask about was her first ever book and her current job is a travelling children's author. The story is supposed to be Romeo and Juliet with a happier ending, but Raku came up with a even happier ending, which his mother prefers. The title Zawsze in Love is a poor translation of 'Forever in Love' (English translation) from Japanese into Polish and decision to use Polish is because of the legend surround the Tumski bridge. The legend is if a couple write their names on lock, attach it to the bridge, and then throw the key into the river below, then they will remain forever united. The poor translation embarrassed Raku's mother, so Hana took the book of her hands so she didn't throw it away. There is not much more information that Raku's mother can give to Chitoge, but suggests she visits the Tenku Highland as that is where she met the other members of the harem 12 years ago.

                    Chitoge has decided to visit the Tenku Highlands and says goodbye to Raku's mother. Raku's mother tells us, the audience, that she knows all about the promise Raku made, but didn't tell Chitoge to not break her heart.<br/>
                    Back in Japan, Shu and Raku are once again talking about Raku's love life, as he still agonises about which girl he should go for (do they talk about anything else? This is the 3rd time this volume). In attempt to alleviate his friend's mental burden, Shu lists a bunch of lucky and extremely rare circumstances which would warrant one contacting someone about and then asks Raku whose is the first person he would want to tell about these circumstances. Raku thinks about for a bit and immediately knows who he is love with. He thanks Shu for his assistance before he gets a phone call from Hana telling him that Chitoge is at the Tenku Highland, so he resolves to go and find her there. He lets Kosaki and Seishiro know (who is in Antarctica) where Chitoge is, while privately Shu updates Marika. Meanwhile Chitoge has arrived at the Tenku Highland.<br/>
                    The bonus comic is about Haru trying to bond with Paula, using the power of her homemade Japanese sweets.
