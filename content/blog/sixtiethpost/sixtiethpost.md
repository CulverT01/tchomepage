                    This is my review of Volume 3 of If Witch Then Which?, the final volume of this series. This volume contains 2 bonus comics which are found on the inside of both the front and back cover of the book and I will review them here as well as all future series that have bonus comics in this section (Laid-Back Camp is notorious for this).<br/>
                    The one at the front is about Haruka wanting to keep his head cool whilst wearing the wig and thinks about going bald, but Maruna disagrees (which he agrees to), so she suggests tying the wig back to allow the neck to breathe. The one at the back continues on, with Haruka trying out different hairstyles, all of which don't suit him, so he decides to suffer through the heat instead.

                    Haruka got little sleep last night because he was rationalising his actions from the night prior - it was CPR. He tells this to Maruna the next morning, but keeps his distance from her, so she struggles to initially hear what he says so she demands that if he insists that it's no big deal, he should treat it like it's no big deal. Haruka runs off all shy as he can't bring himself to kiss Maruna again.<br/>
                    In class, Ms Chloe begins teaching about taboo magic, specifically plant-based taboo magic, but the resident plant-resonator student (Saki Hanamiya) gives her all the answers. Ms Chloe continues to teach, when she notices that Oboro hasn't got her textbook out rather instead her mother's diary, but Oboro provides more information that can only be found in the textbook justify the lack of her own being present. Ms Chloe shows a practical example of taboo magic, with an aroma of a plant that causes non-witches to experience headaches, dizziness, full-body numbness, etc which begins to affect Haruka. Maruna volunteers to escort Haruka to the nurse's office and on the way Haruka convinces her that he can make there himself (in his opinion all he needs is fresh air), but faints before he can arrive.<br/>
                    Haruka awakes in the nurse’s office, sans wig and bra, with the headmistress waiting for him to arise. Haruka wishes for Maruna still be enrolled, but it requires him to confess how he feels about her to the headmistress, who deduces that Haruka likes Maruna and tells him so. He accepts this but knows it will come to nothing as she absolutely hates him. The headmistress informs him that now that she knows his secret, he is expelled from the school, but will tell anyone his secret as well as not tell Maruna that he was found out.<br/>
                    Haruka informs Maruna that he's is quitting school but is aloof about the reason why. She presses him enough that he confesses he has impure feelings towards her and thus can no longer be objective and help like he has been doing. The chapter ends with a root breaking through a school wall and being greeted by someone off-screen (or off-page as this is a book).

                    The chapter begins with Oboro's mother (Saku)'s partner remembering their time together and wishing to speak with her again, whilst holding her diary.<br/>
                    The class is informed of Haruka's departure, with some taking the news harder than others. Maruna remembers what was said last night, with new details that further expand Haruka's 'reason for leaving'. Saki is also angry that Haruka has gone, so Maruna promises to perform for the both of them, which satiates Saki for now. Oboro is concerned that hse has caused Haruka to leave, but Maruna assures that she hasn't. Meanwhile, Saki is still venting about Haruka's departure, when she notices something off about a wall. Her friends see nothing, so she uses the Manifest spell (taboo magic) to briefly reveal a growing mass of roots. Unsure what it is but immediately concerned, she and her friends run to Ms Chloe's office but before they can enter, a tendril wraps around Saki's (and assuming her friends as well) ankle, subduing her. She is not the only one as the headmistress has become incapacitated, while Oboro can't find her mother's diary.<br/>
                    Haruka, meanwhile, is on some swings in a park wondering what to do with his life as he has had no real goal except supporting Maruna's, which he can no longer do. He remembers a conversation he and Maruna had about dreams for the future and especially remembers the moment Maruna sparkled (metaphorically) when describing how she has a dream and wants to show him the fruits of her future labour. The penny drops and Haruka realises that he likes Maruna and goes off to tell her how he feels as well as workout why she hates him, only when he arrives at the school, however, the school is quiet and covered in roots.<br/>
                    Inside, Maruna is being drained by some roots that wrapped around her and she also remembers the conversation that she and Haruka had on those swings, except her memories conveniently continue where Haruka's finished. Wishing someone could save her, she is saved by Haruka, who she immediately hugs upon being freed from the roots. Once the 2 have composed themselves, Haruka asks about the roots, but Maruna can't see the roots so deduces that they are likely from a Moonlit Corpse plant, which is a plant that witches can't see and the most dangerous of all the taboo plants. They head off to find other people and on the way, Maruna explains everyone has been feeling sluggish since this morning. They find a whole load of students who, according to Maruna, are floating but in reality are being held up the the roots of a plant. Oboro hears them and tells them to stake back, but is gagged by the plant as the mastermind behind it all is revealed to be: Ms Chloe! She expects Haruka and Maruna to sympathise with her, although we are not given the reason why, she is holding Saku's diary, so you do the maths. Also, there's no break between this chapter and the next, nor are there page numbers, so I had to manually count the pages to work out where this chapter ended and the next one began.

                    The chapter begins with a flashback, with a young Maruna fretting over Haruka's health after his blood transfusion, but her grandma calms her down by telling her where a witch's power comes from, love, also that this power can make someone weak. We return to the present, where Ms Chloe reveals that she has been looking for Saku for sometime and the fact her diary is in her hands suggests that the her lab has been accessible and Saku's will still exists. Haruka asks Maruna to free the other students before mentioning that she has been calling him by his first name (a big deal in Japanese society) which embarrasses her and raises her blood pressure enough that all the students ensnared by the Moonlit Corpse plant are freed. With more knowledgable characters conscious and aware of the situation, we learn that the reason why Ms Chloe can interact with the Moonlit Corpse plant, is because of the forbidden mark on her sternum (part of a person's torso, located above their breasts and below their neck), which would have caused her great pain and suffering for an entire week and her motivation to do so was to find Saku Kurokami and reunite with her, as Saku and Ms Chloe formed a two halves of one witch partnership like Haruka and Maruna do. With the moon fully risen, the Moonlit Corpse plant can bathe in its light and bloom, which will open a door to the spirit world and Ms Chloe intends to enter to see Saku again. Ms Chloe apologises to all present for the harm (both physical and mental) she has inflicted upon them, before entering into the flower. <br/>
                    Oboro makes a last second plea not to, as there is no spell that can reunite someone with the dead, before asking Haruka for assistance and he does by grabbing onto Ms Chloe, preventing her for falling further into the spirit world. Ms Chloe responds to this attempt to stop her progress by stabbing Haruka's hand with a pair of gardening scissors, but he still does not let go and tells energy taken from other witches should not be used to end another witch's life, which Ms Chloe is trying to do. The roots, in which Haruka was holding onto, give way and the two start to fall in but are caught by Maruna, who is caught by Oboro, who is caught by Hikaru, who caught by Miyu. Miyu calls out for assistance, but everyone is hesitant except Saki, who grabs on to the human chain that's forming and commands her fellow students to do the same, which they do and they all start to slowly pull everyone inside the plant up. Meanwhile, Ms Chloe calls out the void, in hope that Saku can hear, to find out why Saku let go of her hand during her trance and sacrificed herself and Saku's daughter answers with that her mother wanted Ms Chloe to live as that was more important than her own life. This does not give Ms Chloe any solace, so Haruka deduces her thought process, which helps, but Saku appearing helps (in more ways than one) and everyone is safely rescued from the plant.<br/>
                    However, the Moonlit Corpse plant is still growing and at its current rate, will swallow the school in 30 minutes, according to the headmistress. Luckily, Maruna feels like she can stop the plant as moon resonance is super effective against plants and she will have Haruka help her, to which he can do anything he likes to her. Haruka needs sometime to process this as all he has impure thoughts, but after Maruna bandages his injury, he proposes to her. This stuns Maruna into silence, so he gets on one knee and proposes again which does generate a response, but one of confusion. He explains himself that he is going to have impure thoughts every time they touch, which is necessary to activate her powers, but by proposing he has taken on full responsibility for wha happens and so thus it is ok (in his eyes a least). Maruna has yet to give her answer, so Haruka assumes that she does hate him, but she does love him and tells him so before kissing him. This causes one of their hearts to beat wildly and a great power to be released, which Oboro initially assumes it to be Maruna's, but correctly works out that it is instead Haruka's and the Moonlit Corpse plant is vanquished. Haruka turns to the headmistress and reveals that his goal is to become a witch and wishes to re-enrol, with Oboro vouching for him on a practical level as she reveals that he has some latent witch power thanks to the blood he received from Maruna all those years ago. The headmistress agrees and then Nana-chan pops out from Miyu's breast (no wonder she was ok with padded chests) leaps towards Haruka's chest, only to miss and catch his wig instead, pulling it off and exposing himself as a boy.<br/>
                    Haruka restarts his life at school, but this time as a boy and as a bit of a minor celebrity within the school. Miyu is still stuck using the wrong honorific (she refers to him as Haruka-chan rather than Haruka-kun wth the latter being the correct one), Hikaru still sees him as a rival, Saki is shy around him, Oboro threatens to end his existence if makes Maruna cry, and Maruna is just pleased that Haruka is getting along with so many girls. The chapter and as well the series ends with Haruka and Maruna alone on a bench, pledging to each other that they will become great witches and Haruka will be there to save Maruna should she be in danger. The two hold hands and kiss each other.<br/>
                    Technically, the main story ends here, but there is a set of bonus comics that answer some questions as well as pose some questions regarding events in the last few chapters, including one which we already knew because of a flashback back in chapter 1 (I mention it in my review of that chapter) as well as sort-of post credit scene (it's before the author afterword, so the credits haven't rolled in this book) where Haruka asks when did Maruna started hating him, which gets him no real answer so he changes to when she started loving him, which gets him a similar kind of non-answer.

                   This chapter is an one-shot that the author wrote all the way back in 2013. THe plot is similar to chapter 1 of this series with some differences, of which I will list. All named/titled characters look the same as the do in the main series (the art is different, but the design is the same), with the exception of Haruka as his hair is darker and has a tuft at the back of his head, that looks like it has been tied up. However not all characters appear, as we don't see Saki, Oboro, Saku, and technically Hikaru, as we never see her face but we do see the rest of her body. Haruka is never involved in an accident, so his desire to help Maruna comes from wanting to see her achieve her dream as he has none, while Maruna's hatred towards Haruka is more justified as it comes from him dismissing her dream because she has one (he was like 5, cut him some slack) and she uses more violent threats to get Haruka to do her bidding. Maruna never eats a super-spicy curry, instead she drinks coffee and when she collapses in the bathroom, Haruka has the decency to cover her up with a towel (a major difference in personality according to the author). Maruna also doesn't immediately head for the test venue, as after causing harm to Haruka rocks her confidence as a witch, so needs Haruka to inspire her. We never see Maruna and/or Haruka take the test as the chapter ends with Maruna accidentally causing the testing hall to float out of its foundations after she fails pick up a fallen shoe of hers whilst in mid-air with Haruka as the pair had floated from her house to the testing hall.

                    The main problem with this series is the same as one of the problems I had with The Hero and His Elf Bride Open a Pizza Parlor in Another World as it feels like we have speed-ran a romance series and certain characters (Miyu, Hikaru, Saki) weren't fleshed out as much they could have been. The romance was properly handled, as their were hints throughout the series that at least one of the pair loved the other at any given moment, so the confession didn't come out as a sudden surprise. Overall, I think that the series is a 7/10 as while it is better then Nisekoi story- and character-wise, it is hampered by the lack of growth of some characters as well as the series being a bit too short.
