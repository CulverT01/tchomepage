                    This is my review of Nisekoi Volume 12. This volume contains the series' 100th chapter, which seems impressive until you realise we are just about halfway through the series as there are 25 volumes in this series.

                    Whilst cleaning up around Beehive headquarters, Seishiro finds a large jar of Konpeito sugar candy and begins snacking on it on the way to school. Konpeito is sugar candy that comes in various colours and looks like the Star Bits from Super Mario Galaxy Series. After spotting Marika engaging in her morning ritual of hugging Raku, Seishiro enacts punishment against Raku, only for the punch not to hurt and all subsequent punches being merely being ticklish. A convenient phone call from Claude which explains that the candy is drugged to make the eater as weak as a little girl permanently. After more testing of Seishiro's strength, she 'runs' away to sulk in a corner and Raku tells to stop moping and that her strength is not the only thing that people appreciate of her and calls and summons Chitoge to prove his point. After coming to peace with the loss of her strength, she asks Raku what he appreciates of her and his response is her tutoring skills, which annoys her because she interprets that as she nothing more than a studying tool, so she goes to punch him only for it hit at full force, as the drugs doesn't properly affect women and saps them of their strength temporarily.

                     Chitoge wants to confess her feelings, but is unsure about the consequences of doing so - both the positive and the negative. She decides to compromise with herself by writing a love letter, only to immediately rip it up due to how embarrassed she feels. She can confess to a doll, but her practice is cut short by Seishiro entering her room. She consults her father for advice, but his crazy tale of how he wooed Hana was of no use to his daughter. The issue is still on her mind during the next day and she walks into sign whilst out on a date with Raku. Raku notices that there is something on her mind and asks what it is, but she tells him that there's nothing. He then remarks that it has been over a year since they started 'dating' and how scary it is that he has gotten used to it - not that he minds the situation. They bicker for a bit, but no one gets hurt demonstrating the growth in their relationship, before Raku remarks whatever happens they'll take it day by day. This eases Chitoge's internal issues about confessing, so she invites out him for some Ramen - her treat.

                   One of the Shuei-Gumi members has opened a cake shop (Sweets Syuei) opposite Japanese Confections Onodera, much to Mrs Onodera annoyance. When she and her daughters go over to inspect, they find that Raku is working there and ticks her off even more. Mrs Onodera goes over and orders a cake to taste her competition, but her order somehow has an entire rice cake inside (no one believes this), although the incident inspires Raku to create a cake with traditional flavours of Japanese sweets, which sells like hot-cakes. This infuriates Mrs Onodera, so she gets her daughters to dress in outfits that have no sleeves and shorts skirts and is willing to have her daughters show more skin if necessary. Raku decides to create a new product again, with it containing no trace of influence from Japanese sweets, but once again is an immediate crowd pleaser. Later Raku gets a call from Kosaki telling him that her mother going to get her and Haru to swimsuits in order to promote the store and with Kosaki's innocence on the line, he decides to conspire with Haru and Kosaki to create a Western-style Japanese sweet that Japanese Confections Onodera can sell alongside Sweets Syuei's Japanese-style cake as a collaboration between the 2 stores. This restores the traffic Japanese Confections Onodera used to have, although Mrs Onodera refuses to taste it (in front of her daughters at least).

                     A Swimming Meet which decides who attends the national championship is on and Ruri is competing, as she is an avid swimmer as well as the best female swimmer in the entire school by far. She, however, doesn't care about winning and isn't massively enthused when the gang all turn up to cheer her on. Her main competition is Haneko Chonouchi from Shikari Girl's High School, who doesn't think much of Ruri in terms of fans and in appeal (if you know what I mean). The first race goes to Haneko, whose conceited attitude draws the ire from her fellow competitors who try to trip her up, literally, by placing a soda can in her path. Ruri saves Haneko before she can fall, but injures herself in the process and contemplates withdrawing, although Kosaki comes in to explain all her friends are cheering for here and she herself wants to see Ruri competing at the national championship. This motivates Ruri to keep going and she wins the final race to go to Nationals, despite her injury.

                    Paula won't eat her carrots, so Seishiro enlists Raku to help with solving that issue. Paula tries to trick them, but fails, as do they when she manages to suss out which biscuits have grated carrot in them and which ones don't. Seishiro later reveals that Paula can't ride a bike (without stabilisers) and is terrible academically - especially Maths. They slowly make progress with them all as Paula can eat boiled sweet carrots, she begins studying properly and can ride a bike with only one stabiliser.<br />  
                    On another day at school, they announce that all the first years are to receive vaccinations and Paula flees school due to a fear of needles. Seishiro gets Raku to find her, as she is too busy with an errand for Chitoge to help, and advises him to look in high places, because that is where she likes to be alone. Raku finds her and gets her down with the use of a scary story, which is enough to get climb down and then Raku promises to go with her, to get her vaccination. All this is enough to convince her, but the doctor administering the vaccine mentions that there are at least 2 (3 according to the back illustration) after Paula has received her first.

                    Marika has left her parrot Raku Dearest with his namesake, as she is going away for a day and needs someone to look after Raku (the parrot not the person). Unfortunately for Raku (the person not the parrot), Raku Dearest has picked up quite the vocabulary from his owner and will only eat if he is hand-fed and 'Open up, Raku Dearest! Yummy yum yum!' said to him. Raku Ichijo falls asleep and Raku Dearest escapes, but hasn't gone too far, so Raku Ichijo can still track the parrot by listening for any squawking and inappropriate roleplay between him and Marika. Raku Dearest lands next to Chitoge, who creeps her out enough that Raku Ichijo needs a clobbering, even when he attempts to explain who the true owner of the parrot is. Raku Dearest encounters more of Raku Ichijo's friends, who react as you'd expect, before he checks the notes on how to care for Raku Dearest. The notes, luckily, do explain how to get Raku Dearest back: shout 'Oh Marika my sweet beloved! I love you!'. Marika suddenly appears and explains the situation to everyone and promptly leaves whilst listening to a recording of Raku Ichijo saying 'Oh Marika my sweet beloved! I love you!', revealing her true intentions the whole time - further proof why I think she is one of the worst characters in this series.

                    Tanabata is coming up which is a festival celebrated on July 7th in Japan and people (usually children) write a wish and then hang it on bamboo. The stakes are raised with these wishes as the priestess from chapter 64 consecrates the bamboo, meaning her mystic powers ups the odds for the wishes actually coming true. Kosaki's wish is to be Raku's girlfriend, which obviously she is embarrassed about anyone finding out, so she hangs it the atop of the bamboo. Her plan is foolproof, until Raku is selected to move the bamboo, so she tries to volunteer to help, but the teacher believes a strapping young man such Raku is more than enough to move some bamboo - I assume he thinks no harm will come Raku, because there would probably be consequences if it did. Kosaki feigns an illness to leave class and goes to help Raku move the bamboo, but they place the bamboo in the wrong place so a pair of teachers (who should have moved the bamboo in the first place) move it so you cand see the top of the plant from a hallway window, which Raku and Kosaki pass. Kosaki tries to move Raku's focus from the bamboo before deciding to reach out and grab her wish, but nearly falls out of the window and is luckily saved by Raku. Raku rightly chastises her for putting her life in danger, even when she explains her behaviour, so she puts a new wish on instead which is for Raku's to come true and his is for the animals in the school menagerie to love him; which they do - for one day.

                    Chitoge is late to school, so rushes through her morning routine and doesn't tie her hair up properly, so loses her ribbon. When she realises, she is absolutely completely devastated and not even her favourite Ramen on Raku's dime is enough to faintly raise her spirits. Marika taunts Chitoge by telling time that someone probably threw away the ribbon and Chitoge's distraught reaction surprises her. The gang begin to search for the ribbon, but are turning up nothing so Raku decides to buy a replacement ribbon for Chitoge and pass it off as the original, although Chitoge sees through the lie by smelling it (I'm serious). As he is apologising, Raku spots Chitoge's missing ribbon stuck on a utility pole and she chases after it, but it gets ripped to shreds by a passing train. As Chitoge is bawling her eyes out, Raku appears with her original ribbon, as the one she was chasing was the one Raku had bought, which is confirmed by its smell. Chitoge hugs Raku before smacking her, confirming that she is back to normal.

                    The chapter begins with Kosaki inviting her sister to go to the festival with her friends, which will include Raku. Haru accepts but is suspicious of the relationship her sister and Raku have, which is further proved when he compliments her in her yukata, but not Haru in hers. There is a firework called Cupid's Flame, which is said to make a guy and a girl become sweethearts, so Marika has prepared a luxurious seat for Raku and her to sit on. Raku calls out to Kosaki, asking her to keep an eye on Haru, as she can easily get lost, which bother Haru because she thought he was talking to her and tells them to address each other by their first names. The 2 are incredibly bashful and embarrassed at doing this, so Haru leaves with Fu to get some air. Fu teases Haru by saying that Haru is disappointed not to see Cupid's Flame with Raku, to which she quickly denies and goes off to buy food for the 2. She later spots Ruri and Shu talking and eavesdrops on their conversation where she finds out that Raku and Chitoge's relationship is all a lie.<br/>  
                    The bonus comic for this volume continues following the adventures of Magical Confectioner Kosaki, where the magical girls are all gathered to decide who should be the leader of the trio.
