                This is my review of Nisekoi Volume 8. After re-reading the first 7 volumes has made me want to watch the Nisekoi anime agian, which is convenient as this is the first volume to be printed and released (in Japan) after the annoucement that the series would get an anime. Volume 7 had been released after the annoucement, but it would've been a few weeks at most given that Volume 7 was released 4th June 2013 and the anime was annouced on 27th May 2013.

                    Shu has decided to hold his Christmas party again, because apparently the party was no fun without Chitoge and Raku, but the reason is the entire class wants all details about Raku and Chitoge's hotel stay the day prior. At the party, everyone starts looking at the couple suspiciously and when Raku talks Marika and Kosaki, they run away or can't look him in the eye directly. A couple of the female classmates ask Chitoge for some details, which she provides, but not clearing up misunderstanding that they did the 'deed'. The misunderstanding is quickly cleared up after a male classmate asks directly and out loud for the details of their night together. <br />
                    On the walk home from the party, Chitoge asks Raku what her mother (Hana) and he talked about at the airport as they saw her off, which is revealed via flashback. The conversation was Hana revealing that she had worked out that 2 were fake dating, although not initially, and asks if his feelings towards Chitoge were just as fake, while he asks if she knew anything about his pendant which she doesn't, but remembers that it was in Chitoge's favourite picture book - whilst on her flight. Raku decides to tell Chitoge anything about this conversation.
