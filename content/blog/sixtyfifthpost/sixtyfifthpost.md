   Welcome back! The website has been fully updated and it is not only thing that has changed. The circuit has had the chicane after turn 8 removed (where David Beckmann and Mitch Evans collided last year) as well as Porsche running a tribute livery to the Porsche 550 which won the under 1500cc sports car class (as well as 3rd overall) in the 1954 Carrera Panamerica with Hans Herrmann, who passed away just before the race weekend. Between 1950 and 1954, the Carrera Panamerica was a point-to-point rally across Mexico that gained an infamous reputation for being dangerous as 27 people would die over those 4 years, with 9 of those being spectators. It was revived in 1988 as a 'classic' event (classic-looking cars with modern safety built in).<br/>
   The next Formula E race will be the 2026 Miami ePrix on 31st January 2026 at 19:00 UTC and you can find out where to watch it <a href="https://www.fiaformulae.com/en/ways-to-watch">here</a>.

    <h2 class="row">Qualifying</h2>
    <p class="col-8">
    Group A consisted of: Jake Dennis, Nick Cassidy, Nico Mueller, Joel Eriksson, Nyck de Vries, Antonio Felix da Costa, Taylor Barnard, Jean-Eric Vergne, Edoardo Mortara, and Norman Nato. There weren't any issues on track, with the exception for Nick who had a lap-time deleted for track limits Very few made improvements on their final runs, with only the Citroens and Taylor making improvements on their final laps. Jean-Eric also had a 3-place grid penalty to serve after overtaking under Full-Course Yellow in the previous race. The 4 from the group that would move onto the Duel stage were: Jake, Nico, Taylor and Edoardo.<br/>
    Group B went next and consisted of Oliver Rowland, Pascal Wehrlein, Max Guenther, Sebastien Buemi, Zane Maloney, Felipe Drugovich, Josep Maria 'Pepe' Marti, Mitch Evans, Lucas Di Grassi, and Dan Ticktum. This session is cleaner than the first, with only Dan's late braking into turn 1 providing any form of jeopardy. However, unlike Group A, no one made any improvements on their final run which hurt Pascal Wehrlein as he would not make the top 4 and would qualify 6th in the group. 3 drivers in this session had penalties to serve coming into this race, with: Felipe having the same penalty as Jean-Eric for the same reason, Lucas also having a 3-place grid penalty for his collision with Edoardo last time out in Sao Paulo and Pepe having enough penalties that would see him start all the way in Canada. His punishment for his crash last time in Sao Paulo would see him start at the back of the grid regardless of where he qualified and he would have 60-place grid penalty as the crash had damaged his inverter, gearbox and MGU (Motor Generator Unit) enough that they needed changing after FP2, in which he did no running. The 4 that made it into Duel stage from group B were: Sebastien, Dan, Mitch, and Oliver.<br/>
    The 1st Quarter-Final was between Taylor and Nico, with the former winning and the 2nd was between Edoardo and Jake with, again, the former winning and moving onto Semi-Final 1. Quarter-Final 3 was between Mitch and Dan, which saw, for the 3rd consecutive time, the former advance to Semi-final 2 and the final Quarter-Final was between Oliver and Sebastien which saw Sebastien moving on to the Semi-Finals, bucking the trend in the session. Semi-Final 1 was between Edoardo and Taylor, which Taylor won and Semi-Final 2 was between Mitch and Sebastien, with the latter winning. The Final saw Taylor setting the faster time, however, he made a mistake at the final corner and exceeded track limits, thus handing pole position to Sebastien.

    <h2 class="row">Race</h2>
    <h3 class="row">Overall Drivers' Championship</h3>
    <p class="col-8"> 
    Nick Cassidy wins the race from Edoardo Mortara in 2nd and Oliver Rowland in 3rd. He becomes the first driver to win the Sao Paulo from the front row with next highest starting winner being Mitch Evans in Season 9 with 3rd. The race was standard 'peloton' style race with a lot of race leaders as well as, for most of the race, drivers leading no more than 2 consecutive laps. That said, this is more 'peloton' as we set an event record of 8 different race leaders, double what was managed in the first edition in Season 9 (Season 10 and 11 only have 5 apiece). The recipients for the fastest lap point are different as Taylor Barnard takes it under the alternative format, but as he finishes 13th, the fastest lap point in real life goes to Oliver instead.<br/>
    There are few incidents across the race, as at the start Nyck de Vries out-brakes himself and punctures Dan Ticktum's left rear tyre and makes contact with his teammate, taking both off-track. Edoardo Mortara (Nyck's teammate) fails to properly rejoin the race track as, if you go off at turn 1 you are supposed to come to a complete stop and then rejoin by going through 2 bollards, so he picks up a 5 second penalty, which is later rescinded because he was forced off. This is a moot point as on lap 23, Lucas Di Grassi collides with Edoardo on the exit of turn 5, putting the latter out of the race while former retires under subsequent safety car. Lucas is found to be at fault for the accident and will serve a 5 place grid drop for his next race. The Mahindra Racing drivers are not the only teammates to collide as the 2 Nissan Formula E Team drivers collide on the exit of turn 6 on lap 17, with Norman Nato picking up a rear right puncture and retires upon exiting the pits in the run-off for turn 1.<br/>
    Despite having their driver hitting each other as well as having 1 of them retire, neither have the worst weekend on the grid as that goes to Cupra Kiro, as after his puncture, Dan Ticktum picks up 2 drive-through penalties: 1 for wheelspin in the pit-lane and the other was for his team working in the car while it's status is 'ready to move', meaning the car is live and can immediately drive off. This poses a risk to the mechanics as the car could suddenly set off and run them over or they receive a possible deadly shock (Formula E powertrains when properly active produce a voltage over 60 volts, which can be enough to kill) and in Kiro's defence, Mahindra are also caught out by this as well.<br/>
    The other Kiro driver, Josep Maria 'Pepe' Marti, crashes under Full Course Yellow or FCY (called after Mitch Evans and Sebastien Buemi collide, resulting in Mitch to end up in the barriers at turn 10) after failing to properly slow down for it and vaults over Nico Mueller's and Antonio Felix da Costa's cars with the latter picking up the most damage. Pepe barrel-rolls down the straight between turns 6 and 7 and this accident only occurs due to difference in procedure compared to what normally happens under Virtual Safety Car (VSC) in Formula 2 (Pepe's most recent series prior to Formula E). In Formula 2, when a VSC is called, drivers immediately slow down, while for a FCY, a countdown is broadcasted to all driver by the race director and you are supposed to start slowing down from the beginning of the countdown, which the vastly more experienced Antonio and Nico did. Pepe will start at the back of the grid for the next, regardless of where he qualifies.<br/>
    In Pepe's defence, he is not the only driver to fall foul of FCY rules as fellow rookie Felipe Drugovich picks up 2 5-second penalties (1 is converted to a 3 place grid drop for his next race) for speeding under FCY and overtaking under FCY as well as 2-time (in real life) Formula E champion Jean-Eric Vergne, who also speeds under FCY. Jean-Eric retires under the red flag in the pits, (called for Pepe's incident) due to 'collision damage', but is classified behind him (don't ask).<br/>
    2 drivers have less points under the alternative format compared to real life, Jake and Oliver, as the former has 21 points under the alternative format compared to 25 in real life and the latter has 18 under the alternative format compared to 19 in real life. Nick, Pascal Wehrlein, and all drivers who finished 14th or lower match their points totals across both formats and the driver who has the most points compared to real life is Antonio, who has 6 more points under the alternative format compared to real life. The standings are the same across both formats as it is quite hard to have a difference after 1 race.<br/>
    Below are the overall Drivers' Championship standings:

    <h3 class="row">Customer Trophy for Drivers</h3>
    <p class="col-8">
    The class is won by overall race winner Jake Dennis with 2nd in class going to Joel Eriksson and 3rd to Sebastien Buemi. Felipe Drugovich initially finishes 2nd in class, but drops to 4th the after 5 second time penalty for speeding under Full Course Yellow. For the majority of the race, Jake leads the class and only initially stops on lap 12, as he is overtaken by Sebastien on the exit of turn 5, while the latter is in Attack Mode. Jake retakes the lead going into turn 1 on lap 15 and maintains it for the rest of the Prix as he is under no threat by any of his fellow competitors in the class and his teammate is only one who gets anywhere close to him.<br/>
    Below are the Customer Trophy for Drivers standings:

    <h3 class="row">Nelson Piquet Jr Trophy</h3>
    <p class="col-8">
    The winner of the class is Nico Muller with 2nd going to Joel Eriksson and 3rd to Zane Maloney. Felipe Drugovich had initially won the class, meaning we were at least guaranteed that Nico wouldn't sweep all the races for the trophy as: he is in the best equipment and has the most experience by far. However, that speeding under Full Course Yellow penalty sees Felipe drop to 4th in class and Nico to win it. Nico leads from the get go and only relinquishes the lead to Josep Maria Marti on lap 15 after going through Attack Mode loop, before retaking the lead on lap 17 through turn 3. He maintains this until lap 23, when taking his 2nd Attack Mode, he briefly loses the class lead to Joel Eriksson, who also is in his 2nd Attack Mode as well, but beats him into turn 4 on the same lap. He loses the class lead on the road on lap 28 as Felipe, in Attack Mode, breezes past him down the pit straight and into turn 1.<br/>

    <h3 class="row">Overall Teams' Championship</h3>
    <p class="col-8">
    With the win, Andretti Formula E lead the standings under both formats and are tied with Porsche Formula E Team in terms of points under both formats as well. They and Nissan Formula E Team (3rd place under both formats) are the only team to score less points under the alternative format, with the former 2 being 1 point down under the alternative format and the latter 2 points off under the alternative format. Citroen Racing Formula E Team and Cupra Kiro are the only teams to tie points totals across both formats as Kiro cars retire (one more spectacularly than the other) so score 0 points under both formats and Citroen's only finishing car finishes 3rd, scores the same amount of points across both formats. Everyone else scores more points, which benefits Envision Racing as they score 17 points and thus tie with Nissan, so are ahead of Citroen under the alternative format to be 4th instead of 5th like they are in real life. There are no other changes between the 2 formats in terms of the standings. Envision gained most points under the alternative format compared to real life as they gain 7 points over their real life total.<br/>
    Below are the overall Teams' Championship standings:

    <h3 class="row">Customer Teams' Championship </h3>
    <p class="col-8">
    As Jake Dennis won the Customer Driver class, Andretti Formula E lead the class with 20 points over Envision Racing who have 17. Before Felipe's Drugovich's penalty, Envision only had 15, as Andretti claimed a class 1-2, so are now 2 points closer which doesn't seem like much, but remember that last year 3 points (the current gap) separated NEOM McLaren Formula E Team (1st) from Andretti (4th), so those points that Envision gained could matter come London. Also, don't rule Kiro out of title contention already, as Andretti had a woeful start to Season 11 in the Customer class and almost won the teams' title at the final race.<br/>

    <h3 class="row">Manufacturers' Cup</h3>
    <p class="col-8">
    Stellantis lead the standings in Manufacturers' Cup under the alternative format with points total of 28 over Porsche, who tie with them, but lose on countback as Stellantis have a 2nd to Porsche's 3rd as their best result. 3rd goes to Nissan who have 20 points under the alternative format. Only Porsche and Jaguar have less points under the alternative format as their best performing (or Jaguar's case best 2) driver is a customer driver, who cannot score points for a manufacturer under the alternative format. This means there are changes between the standings, with only Nissan maintaining the same standing position across both formats. Porsche and Stellantis swap as Porsche have 37 points in real life to Stellantis' 25 in real life and Jaguar drop to 6th and push Mahindra and Lola-Yamaha up a place to finish 4th and 5th respectively. Lola has the biggest positive points difference between their alternative points total and their real life total at 7 (9 point under the alternative format and 2 in real life).<br/>
