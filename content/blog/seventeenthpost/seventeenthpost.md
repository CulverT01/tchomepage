                    Welcome to my review of Nisekoi Volume 4. Personally, if you're reading this series, then you're reading it for the romance and interactions between the main leads rather than the comedy but if you can find comedy within these interactions then more power to you.

                    The chapter begins with Tsugumi finding a love letter in her shoe locker from Toru Suzuya - an intelligent, attractive and athletic member of the school's football (soccer) team. Unfortunatly for Toru, Tsugumi doesn't know what a love letter is, but Ruri is only too happy to part with such information, which flusters Tsugumi a lot. Onodera assumes that Tsugumi is going ot reject Toru, as Tsugumi loves someone else, to which she vehemently denies. She asks what she should do and is told to think about it and respond based on what she wants, so she thinks about it and does so on the roof during lunch. Her solitude is broken when Raku comes up to the roof to eat his lunch because his girlfriend is eating lunch with her girl friends. Tsugumi wants to be alone and asks him leave curtly, but still asks him about 'type of guy' means and Raku explains, so she then asks him what his type of girl is, because she wants an example - it's not like she likes him or anything! Raku initally describing Onodera, before realising his 'type' is Chitoge, and instead describes her, but description ends up being closer to Tsugumi. Tsugumi asks about 'going out' and Raku explains that Toru wants tob Tsugumi's boyfriend, but she can't accept that, as she has to protect Chitoge, and asks why anyone would fall in love with her. Raku tells to get over it , people fall in love all the time nad the decent thing is to give him answer in person. Tsugumi finally asks Raku how he'd feel if he got a love letter from her and responds that it'd be goo to recieve such a letter, so she explodes right in front of him (metaphorically). After school that day, Tsugumi meets with Toru and rejects him before metting with everyone as they were listening in. She thanks Raku for what he said, which confuses him, before shooting Shu as he attempts to reveal her crush to Raku.
