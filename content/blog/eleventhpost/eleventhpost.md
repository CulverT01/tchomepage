                    When deciding what my first Manga series I should review, mind went to the first series I ever bought - Nisekoi. I started buying this series after I had seen the anime and wanted to see how it ends and began buying the series when I was about 16. I have read and enjoyed the entire series, so this review series will allow me to look back on the series and see if overall opinion of Nisekoi changes.

                    The chapter starts with a scene set 10 years prior to the present in the manga where 2 kids, a boy and a girl, promise to marry over pendant with a lock in it by saying 'Zawsze in Love' which means 'Forever in Love'.The boy turns out to be Raku Ichigo, the male lead for this series, who is the heir to the yakuza syndicate (japanese mafia) Shuei-Gumi. However, Raku doesn't want to inherit this instead graduating from university and becoming a civil servant. From the opening pages we learn that Raku is more a lover than a fighter, owing to his execellent cooking skils and lack of fighting prowess. Good job he's the protagonist of a rom-com series rather than an action one. We also learn about the Ichijo family creed, whose first two rules are: 'Never turn yer back on yer enemies.' and 'Always brush yer teeth.' therefore, basic hygiene ranks above loyalty and that makes me chuckle a bit. <br />
                    The story then moves onto Raku's school where we are introduced to 3 other characters: Shu Maiko, Kosaki Onodera, and Chitoge Kirisaki. They are Raku's best friend, his crush and the girl who knees him in the face. Shu is girl-crazy and heavily interested if there are hot girls around, while Onodera is very caring towards Raku, which he certainly likes, and nice towards everyone. Raku doesn't like what Chitoge did and she doesn't like his overreaction to the whole incident, so they naturally hate each other. Unfortunately, as Chitoge is half-American, half-Japanese and is new to Japan, thus needs someone help settle in at school and who better than Raku. As 'punishment' for kneeing him earlier, Raku enlists Chitoge to help find his pendant (the one from the start) that was lost when they collided with each other. <br />
                    When they not searching for the pendant we see some interactions between Chitoge and Raku such as: Them arguing how best take care of the animals the school have, Raku giving Chitoge some notes on Japanese class (which she struggles with) and Raku asking why Chitoge transferred in the middle of the year to which she dismisses the question. However day 7 of their search, Chitoge whines that some of the girls in their class think that they're dating and the notion of which annoys her, they're never going to find the pendant, someone has proably found the pendant and thrown it away as they think it is rubbish and Raku is a loser for caring so much about that pendant just beacuse some girl long ago gave it to him. The final statement pushes Raku over the edge and he loses his temper and tells her to quit if she feels that way, so she does. It also inexplicably starts raining for reasons. Raku continues to search for the pendant, but to no avail until Chitoge throws it at him because she found it and they're not speaking. Raku then wonders if Chitoge is right and should give up on the promise he made with that pendant, only for Onodera to tell him not to because the girl who made promise may still remember and that girl would sad if she found out that he had done that. But what does she know, it's not like she's the girl who made the promise 10 years ago anyway.<br />
                    The chapter ends with Raku returning home only for his father to call him to a meeting where, in order to prevent an all-out gang war between Shuei-Gumi and new gang that has moved in, he is to become lovers with the daughter of the boss of the rival gang who is Chitoge Kirisaki - the girl he's been feuding with at school. At the back of the chapter, there is an illustration which shows a alligator with Chitoge asking if the animal was abandoned, to which Raku confirms saying it was found in a cardboard box like an abandoned kitten. This got a chuckle out of me.

                    The chapter picks up after the end of chapter 1 in which Raku's father introduces his son to Chitoge and her father, Adelt Kirisaki-Wagner, who is the leader of the Beehive Gang - the new gang that moved in. Chitoge and Raku immediately dismiss the entire concept of them dating, even if it is 'pretend', due to them loathing each other. Their complaints are ignored and before they can protest any further, the Beehive gang burst in demanding that Shuei-Gumi return Chitoge because they believe Shuei-Gumi have kidnapped her. Before an all-out battle can begin, the 2 bosses reveal that their children and in love with each other and they support the relationship. The Shuei-Gumi boys are overjoyed at the news that Raku has a girlfriend, while Claude, the top executive at Beehive, is happy to see Chitoge grow up into a woman. The 2 gangs immediately start grilling the couple whose answers, no matter how terrible, are enough to convince them that they are really in love. <br />
                    Raku and Chitoge get some time alone which allows them reflect on their current situation. Raku thanks Chitoge for finding his pendant in the previous chapter and she responds by asking the story behind it. He explains the story behind it to which she gives a positive opinion on it, which is nice change from all the insults she tends to throw his way. The chapter finishes on a new day with Chitoge appearing at Raku's asking if he wants to go out on a date, of which neither has any choice in the matter. The back illustration is a gorilla singing a japanese folk song into a banana, which is a reference to answer Raku gave during the cross-examination in this chapter, and I found this funny.
