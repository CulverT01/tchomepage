                    When deciding what my first Manga series I should review, mind went to the first series I ever bought - Nisekoi. I started buying this series after I had seen the anime and wanted to see how it ends and began buying the series when I was about 16. I have read and enjoyed the entire series, so this review series will allow me to look back on the series and see if overall opinion of Nisekoi changes.

                    The chapter starts with a scene set 10 years prior to the present in the manga where 2 kids, a boy and a girl, promise to marry over pendant with a lock in it by saying &lsquo;Zawsze in Love&rsquo; which means &lsquo;Forever in Love&rsquo;.The boy turns out to be Raku Ichigo, the male lead for this series, who is the heir to the yakuza syndicate (japanese mafia) Shuei-Gumi. However, Raku doesn't want to inherit this instead, graduating from university and becoming a civil servant. From the opening pages we learn that Raku is more a lover than a fighter, owing to his execellent cooking skils and lack of fighting prowess. Good job he's the protagonist of a rom-com series rather than an action one. We also learn about the Ichijo family creed, whose first two rules are: &lsquo;Never turn yer back on yer enemies.&rsquo; and &lsquo;Always brush yer teeth.&rsquo; therefore, basic hygiene ranks above loyalty and I find that hilarious. <br />
                    The story continues with Raku being taken to school by the members of Shuei-Gumi in a limousine, which doesn't help him trying to hide that part of him. Some Shuei-Gumi members alert Raku that there's a new gang in town and clashes between them and new gang are getting more violent, so want him to take care. As Raku walks into school, he's kneed in the face by a girl who quickly apologises and runs off after jumping off the school wall. We get introduced to 2 new characters, Onodera (Raku's crush) and Shu Maiko (Raku's best friend) whose name isn't revealed in this volume, but plays big enough role that it's worth mentioning.
