                    This is my review of Volume 21 of Nisekoi and this one is going to be Marika-focussed volume, which should see Raku finally set the record straight with Marika about how he feels about her. Also this volume has the last chapter of Magical Confectioner Kosaki.

                    It is Valentine's day Raku has received chocolate from all the women in his life except 1: Marika Tachibana. Marika is absent today, so Chitoge suggests visiting her to see how she is doing, so she and Raku make plans to head to her home after school (Kosaki is working today). On their way out of school, Marika greets them by the school entrance as while she is sick, she is "well enough" to give Raku something important. Marika escorts them to her home and on the way, gets a phone call from her mother which she quickly ignores. Marika then explains that she hates her mother and describes her as a monster, so wishes not to communicate with her. Later on the walk, Chitoge notices the she has left her school bag at school and rushes back to get it, leaving Raku and Marika alone so she can hand him her Valentine's chocolate: a chocolate engagement ring which can be worn (it won't melt and it fits his finger) as well as be accepted as a token of her love. Raku begins to brush off the confession, but then realises he is avoiding the issue again, and begins to properly confess the truth. Marika interrupts him to reveal that she knows that he is secretly in love with Kosaki, his and Chitoge's relationship is fake, and she ready to accept any answer he gives.

                    Marika makes desperate plea to Raku to accept her feelings, but before he can tell her the truth, she collapses on the ground whilst burning up. Honda suddenly appears and carries Marika away, bounding and gagging her to prevent her running off, as well as telling Raku that he should forget about Marika. <br/>
                    The next day, Yui announces to the class that Marika has changed schools yesterday and has returned home to Kyushu. Raku tries to call Marika (in class) and can't reach her. The next day, the gang all meet up on the school roof and discuss what they can find out about Marika's transfer. They have nothing, as there is almost no documents confirming her being in Bonyari. Chitoge mentions heading to Kyushu to find her, which inspires Raku to call someone.

                    The person Raku calls is Mikage who explains that Marika has switched schools as she and her mother made a deal that she could go to Bonyari to try to get Raku to marry her, but if Marika got too sick (in Honda's opinion) or she could win Raku's love before that then: she must come home, marry a man of Marika's mother's choosing, and never go against her ever again. In case you didn't know (which you shouldn't this is the first time this being revealed), Marika's family has been around since the time of the Samurai and is run as a grand matriarchy, so her mother is the head of the family and what she says goes. Mikage reveals more about the relationship between Marika and her mother which boils down to Marika's mother viewing Marika as nothing more than a tool to continue the lineage. Mikage reveals the that Marika's groom-to-be is a divorced steel magnate in his 40s and they are to be wedded tomorrow. Raku is hesitant at what to do, as he wants to save her from this marriage but still has to reject her, so Chitoge snaps him back to reality and he decides to try and rescue Marika with everyone else coming along. The first hurdle is actually getting to Kyushu, but luckily Yui (who has been listening in) has sorted out plane tickets for all of them (except herself) and will stay behind to smooth things over back in Bonyari.

                    The gang set off for Kyushu, while Mikage internally regrets not telling them 'the most important part'. Meanwhile, while waiting for her mother, Marika tries to run away but Honda catches and restrains her before she can get far. Marika meets her mother (who is hidden in the shadows) and asks for her weeding to be in the western tradition as well as letting her return to Bonyari and to leave her alone forever. Her mother agrees to the first demand, but refuses to agree to the second part - they made a deal and Marika lost, it is only fair.<br/>
                    The gang arrive at Marika's home and Raku immediately tries the intercom, but is refused entry. Chitoge notices that a window is broken and has an idea. Meanwhile, Mikage has come to visit Marika and notices the dire state she is in. She remarks that if Marika is so sad, then she must have really enjoyed it and Marika agrees as she was with Raku. Mikage asks about the others which prompts Marika to say good things about the other, but doesn't say anything about Chitoge. Mikage asks she wants to see them again nad Marika does, but knows that she can't as there is no way that they would know where she is. Suddenly, a loud shout calling for Marika is heard.

                    Marika dashes to her window and spots her friends outside and immediately tries to go and see them, but is stopped by Honda as her mother has forbidden her from seeing her friends from Bonyari (friends from Kyushu are a-okay, I mean it is not like they are going to collude with those from Bonyari are they?). As the gang are chased away by some guards, Marika chastises Mikage for her actions who remains convinced that this is what Marika wants. Mikage quickly leaves and meets up with the gang nad finds out their reason for visiting and introduces them to a secret passage that will get them into the house. Raku, Chitoge and Seishiro (the main characters and the one with any combat expertise) head through while the rest stay behind (don't worry, Mikage has a use for them). The three finally arrive inside the house and are met by Honda. Raku pleads with her to help Marika, but Honda ignores this as her loyalty lies with the Tachibana family and its grand matriarch - Marika' mother, Chika Tachibana.<i> Now, Beehive could easily moved out of Japan if they had trained Seishiro like this - just saying.</i> Also Honda may be employed by the police force in Bonyari, but her primary job since birth has been a secret bodyguard, as her family specialises in intelligence gathering, monitoring, sabotage, other undercover work, etc. This means that Honda is basically a ninja. Undeterred by this revelation, Seishiro is willing to fight Honda, to allow Chitoge and Raku to find Chika and talk some sense into her - good luck to all.

                    Raku is hesitant to leave Seishiro behind, but she assures him, that his involvement with the fight will only be a hindrance to her. Raku and Chitoge leave, with Chitoge asking Seishiro to not hurt Honda. Seishiro is surprised that Honda let the other 2 go, but she also feels that they would get in the way of the fight (the regular guards can handle them). Seishiro reveals her weapon of choice, which Honda correctly identifies as "a subsonic magazine with silencer, loaded with tranq bullets" (I know nothing of guns so I'm directly quoting the Viz Media translation) and she also reveals her weapon of choice: a combat chain. Honda disappears in front of Seishiro and drop kicks her from behind, which Seishiro parries. Honda tries to wrap the chain around Seishiro, who dodges it and then has to continue to dodge the chain being thrown towards her. Seishiro tries to fire some tranq bullets at Honda, but she deflects them with her chain. Honda manages to get her chain wrapped around one of Seishiro's ankles and swings her across 3 pillars holding up the room, shattering them. Seishiro escapes unharmed and begins firing at Honda's chains using her revolver (I think). Honda deflects the bullets, but is distracted enough that Seishiro can launch a kick at her, but not enough as Honda parries it. The 2 continue to trade blows, neither being able to pull out an advantage. Honda asks why Seishiro has all this way and Seishiro explains that she is here to support Chitoge in her quest to convince Chika to cancel the wedding and let Marika return to Bonyari. Honda is convinced that cannot happen even if Chika agreed to it, which is nigh on impossible. She explains why, which shocks Seishiro and causes her to lower her guard, allowing Honda to deploy 2 hidden crossbows that armed with combat chains and they fire at Seishiro, binding her. <br/>
                    Meanwhile, Marika hears a commotion outside and assumes it is Raku, which it is as well as Chitoge.

                    Raku and Chitoge are being chased by the guards as both contributed to them being spotted (they blame each other). There are soon trapped in a corridor as a group of guards start charging towards them along with the group chasing them, so jump out of a window. There, Chitoge throws Raku up a floor, allowing escape the guards and find Chika. Soon after re-entering the house, Raku encounters Chika and assumes that she is Marika's sister, but Chika corrects him. Chika already knows who Raku is and that he is the object of Marika's affections. Raku apologies for barging into her house uninvited and asks for Chika to cancel the wedding and while he understands that the 2 made a promise, it is less cruel towards Marika if she doesn't marry someone she has never met or knows. Chika counters that it is normal for parent's to arrange marriages for their children and Raku argues Marika doesn't want to, even if it is to secure the Tachibana lineage for the future. Chika asks Raku if he is willing to marry Marika, knowing full well how he feels about her and accuses him of hypocrisy. Raku understands he is not the best person to arguing for Marika, but still believes that Marika should be granted more time before she marries nad that it is important for Chika the Marika is happy. Chika unequivocally disagrees with Raku's statement as she was never granted such freedom by her mother and same applies to all female ancestors of the Tachibana family. Raku accuses her of imposing her will on Marika and she agrees that she as that is her right as parent and accuses him of imposing his will on herself by trying to prevent Marika from getting married. Their conversation is interrupted by Honda, who is instructed by Chika to take Raku to dungeon and then hand him to the police the next day - Remember kids, Trespassing is a crime! Raku asks Chika how she feels about Marika, which she sees as an attempt to get to confess her love for her daughter and that sickens her. <br/>
                    Meanwhile, Marika has picked the lock on her room's door open.

                    Marika finds Honda on the other side and asks what the noise was about. Honda refuses to give any details, so Marika is left to her (correct) assumptions that it was Raku and his friends.<br/>
                    Meanwhile Chitoge is trying kick down the bars of her cell in the dungeon, while Seishiro contemplates what Honda told her and whether she should Chitoge about it.<br/>
                    Also meanwhile, Raku has been dropped off in his cell and is mad about how Chika views her daughter. He soon discovers he is not alone, as Marika’s father is in the same cell. He had tried to talk to his wife about Marika’s upcoming marriage, but got less further than Raku (he at least spoke to her). Marika’s father believes that his wife acts like she does towards her daughter because she tried to live her own life (like going to a school of her own choosing), but her parents stopped her so she takes her frustrations out on her daughter under the disguise of tradition. Raku, who wishes to rebel against his own family’s tradition, doesn’t understand why such traditions need to be followed if they are just going to cause harm.<br/>
                    The next morning, Mikage appears outside Raku’s cell jangling the keys to his cell as she had anticipated that Raku and the others would be captured. Marika’s father decides to stay behind, leaving Mikage and Raku to escape and meet up with Chitoge and Seishiro (if you’re wondering about the guards, Mikage knocked them out with some powerful meds).

                    Raku recounts his conversation with Chika to Chitoge, Seishiro, Mikage and Shu before explaining the plan on how stop the wedding - kidnapping Marika. Before he goes any further, he explains the risks associated with the plan (committing crimes) as well as where Marika would be stay - his place. Chitoge disagrees with the last part, so Raku compromises so Marika will stay with Chitoge instead (pray and hope the Beehive isn’t raided). Raku asks if Mikage is ok with the plan and she is: in fact she has 2 operatives stationed inside the house (Kosaki and Ruri of which only 1 knows what they’re doing). They go into more detail about the plan, which is to kidnap Marika as she is being escorted to the wedding venue from her dressing room just before the ceremony. This is the only time they can do this because security is on high alert (after 3 people tried some breaking and entering) and they won’t be able to access the dressing room nor wedding venue, but the corridor in the between them, that is the house’s exhaust port. As Raku and Chitoge set off to put the plan in motion, Seishiro asks Mikage if what Honda said to her is true and if she still is okay with it if the plan succeeds, to which the answer to both parts is yes.<br/>
                    As Marika is being dressed for the wedding, one of her attendants asks if she wants to wear the marigold hair accessory, to which she does and Marika begins reminiscing about the time Raku gave her that hair accessory.<br/>
                    The bonus comic this time is the final chapter for Magical Confectioner Kosaki which details life after defeating Dr Maiko, where a surprise visit from Rurin for Kosaki during her class at school.
