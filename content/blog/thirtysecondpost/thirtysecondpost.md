                    This is my review of Nisekoi Volume 12. This volume contains the series' 100th chapter, which seems impressive until you realise we are not even halfway through the series as there are 26 volumes in this series.

                    Whilst cleaning up around Beehive headquarters, Seishiro finds a large jar of Konpeito sugar candy and begins snacking on it on the way to school. After spotting Marika engaging in her morning ritual of hugging Raku, Sesihiro enacts punishment against Raku, only for the punch not to hurt and all subsquent punches being merely being ticklish. A convient phonecall from Claude which explains that the candy is drugged to make the eater as weak as a little girl permanently. After more testing of Seishiro's strength, she 'runs' away to sulk in a corner and Raku tells to stop moping and that her strength is not the only thing that people appreciate of her and calls and summons Chitoge to prove his point. After coming to peace with the loss of her strength, she asks Raku what he appreicates of her and his response is her tutoring skills, which annoys her because she inteprets that as she nothing more than a studying tool, so she goes to punch him only for it hit at full force, as the drugs doesn't properly affect women and saps them of their strength temporarily.

                     Chitoge wants to confess her feelings, but is unsure about the consequences of doing so - both the positive and the negative. She decides to compromise with herself by writing a love letter, only to immediately rip it up due to how embarassed she feels. She can confess to a doll, but her practice is cut short by Seshiro entering her room. She consults her father for advice, but his crazy tale of how he wooed Hana was of no use to his daughter. The issue is still on her mind during the next day and she walks into sign whilst out on a date with Raku. Raku notices that there is something on her mind and asks what it is, but she tells him that there's nothing. He then remarks that it has been over a year since they started 'dating' and how scary it is that he has gotten used to it - not that he minds the situation. They bicker for a bit, but no one gets hurt demonstraing the growth in their relationship, before Raku remarks what ever happens they'll take it day by day. This eases Chitoge's internal issues about confessing, so she invites out him for some Ramen - her treat.

                    One of the Shuei-Gumi members has opened a cake shop (Sweets Syuei) opposite Japanese Confections Onodera, much to Mrs Onodera annoyance. When she and her daughters go over to inspect, they find that Raku is working there and ticks her off even more. Mrs Onodera goes over and orders a cake to taste her competition, but her orders some how has a enire rice cake inside (no one believes this) , although the incident inspires Raku to create a cake with traditional flaovours of Japanese sweets, which sells like hot-cakes. This infuriates Mrs Onodera, so she gets her daughters to dress in outfits that have no sleeves and shorts skirts and is willing to have her daughters show more skin if necessary. Raku decides to create a new product again, with it containing no trace of influence from Japanese sweets, but once again is an immediate crowd pleaser. Later Raku gets a call from Kosaki telling him that her mother going to get her and Haru to swimsuits in order to promote the store and with Kosaki's innocence on the line, he decides to conspire with Haru and Kosaki to create a Western-style Japanese sweet that Japanese Confections Onodera can sell alongside Sweets Syuei's Japanese-style cake as a collaboration between the 2 stores. This restores the traffic Japanese Confections Onodera used to have, although Mrs Onodera refuses to taste it (in fron of her daughters at least).
