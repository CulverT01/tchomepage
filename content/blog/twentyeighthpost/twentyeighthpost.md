                    This is my review of Nisekoi Volume 10. This volume will be mainly focussed on Shu, who is not one of my favourite characters, so hopefully this volume can change my opinion on him. Also, there will be no post next week as I am away this weekend, so the first update to Alternative Formula E Points Format project will be the week after.

                    There are some plumbing issues at the Shuei-Gumi household, so Raku has gone to the local public bathhouse to wash up. There, he meets Chitoge, who is there as she is interested in public baths. Inside, Chitoge meets Marika, who has just walked in, and she immediately scales the partition separating the men's and women's sides of the bath as soon as she hears Raku's voice, so Chitoge has to pull her down and throw a bowl at Raku for staring. The bowl convinces Raku to speed up and he leaves the bath just as Kosaki and Haru enter. The lady at the desk, who Raku calls Granny, has to run some errands, so leaves Raku in charge, but he is hesitant to accept in case there's a problem on the women's side and Chitoge spots him. As soon as she leaves, some older women ask for Raku to fix a broken faucet and he does so blindfolded, mostly for his own benefit, so has them guide him inside. Unfortunately, their instructions end up with him cornering Kosaki, but Haru comes in flying to save her sister, although recovering from the attack Raku knocks the into the broken faucet, causing it spray Kosaki and nearly knock off her towel, but Raku is chased out before he sees anything. Raku is then called into the women's bath as 2 girls (Marika and Chitoge) have passed out in the sauna, so he goes in and begins to carry Chitoge out, only for her towel to slip and in the panic to pull it up to cover Chitoge, he slips on the floor.

                    Raku's home-room teacher Ms Kyoko assigns Raku to organize the clean-up of the school pool, as she was supposed to organize that herself, but had completely forgot about it. The next day, Raku and the gang all arrive at the pool, with this being first time Paula and Fu are introduced to the 2nd year students. The pool is cleaned, so they decide to have lunch, made by Haru and Kosaki, using the best of their talents. Paula, decides not to sit with everyone else, instead choosing to be up in a tree, so Haru climbs up to her, to give her portion of food, but Paula refuses and so Haru decides to eat her lunch there instead. Haru attempts to break the ice, by pointing the similar kind of relationship she has with her sister, that Paula has with Seishiro, but it goes nowhere. Everyone starts to play in the pool, so Paula decides to leave and observe those playing from afar using binoculars. Raku finds her and pours a bucket of water over her, which annoys her, but he tells her to stop being stupid and stubborn and join if she really wants to, which she attempts to do, only for the fact that she can't swim, putting a stop to any frivolity being had.

                    Raku and Ruri have been assigned as the classroom helpers and need to return some extra printouts to the teacher's office. On the journey to the office, Ruri moans how much of a jerk Shu is and lets slip that he has a crush, assuming Raku already knew about it. This, however, is news to Raku and he immediately questions Shu (who has conveniently appeared in the hallway) about why he didn't already know, so Shu escorts him to the roof to have one-on-one conversation. There, Raku tries to guess who Shu's crush is, but Shu doesn't do straight answers, so he knows as much about the mystery woman at the end of the conversation as he did at the start. Upon leaving the roof, Shu crosses paths with Seishiro, who swiftly punches him in the gut after he tries to solicit a hug out of her. To try better understand Shu's mindset, Raku asks Seishiro what she would if she had a crush on someone, but could never be with them and her response is to keep her feelings secret and tell no one, especially not the person she is in love with. The chapter ends with Shu delivering some materials to Ms Kyoko, who rewards him with some leftover cookies and the fact that she is getting married in a month and will be retiring from teaching at the same time.

                    The chapter begins with Ms Kyoko announcing her upcoming marriage and subsequent retirement to the class, who all are extremely happy for her. This announcement is the subject of conversation between Raku and Shu, during which Raku works out who Shu's crush is based on his input in the conversations - Ms Kyoko. Raku asks what Shu is going to do about it and Shu is going do nothing, because confessing would be annoying for her and assumes it will become a bittersweet memory of his youth. In no position to criticise someone for not confessing their feelings, Raku accepts Shu's decision even if he is not sure that it is the right course of action to take. Raku seeks advice from Seishiro and asks her what she would do if the person she liked was getting married and her response would be not to confess her feelings, as there is nothing, she can do to change their mind. However Raku is not fully convinced that this is the right course of action.<br/>
                    Ms Kyoko's last day is only a day away and Raku tells Shu that he supports his decision to not confess, but he wants to at least treat him to a meal, to help drown his sorrows. Upon the Ms Kyoko's last day, Seishiro dashes to Raku to tell him something important.

                    The chapter continues from the last one and Seishiro explains that she wanted to clarify her answer from the last chapter. The clarification is that while not confessing is the most sensible course of action to take, she would be okay with it, which she believes is the entire point of Raku's hypothetical scenario from last chapter. This convinces Raku that what Shu is doing is wrong and races to find him. He finds Shu on the roof and tells him that he willing to give him a push if needed. Shu responds that he doesn't need one, which Raku calls out as lie, so he asks for an 'ultra mega push' and Raku delivers with a massive kick up his backside whilst telling him where Ms Kyoko is going to be. Shu runs to Ms Kyoko and confessing his feelings and rejected as he expected. Raku catches up with him and asks if he should’ve minded his own business, to which Shu tells him no and that he wants some Takoyaki (Bits of octopus fried in balls of pancake batter). Whilst eating the Takoyaki, Shu reminds Raku that he still needs to confess to Kosaki and is willing to give him a push when necessary. The chapter ends with Raku asking Kosaki to walk home with him, which on the back illustration of the chapter is revealed to be with everyone.

                    Kosaki is sick and Ruri has asked Raku to go in her stead, only Kosaki doesn't knows this and is extremely surprised when he arrives. Raku is ecstatic at the prospect of just him and Kosaki, but forgets that Haru might be there as well - which she is. Haru tries to escort Raku out of her home, only for him to bribe her with Strawberry Daifuku to allow himself to stay. Raku volunteers to make some rice porridge, which Haru will assist with, as she questions why Raku is here to care for her sick sister when he has a hot girlfriend like Chitoge and his lack of a proper response only fuels her suspicion. They serve Kosaki her rice porridge, which Haru feeds to her, before leaving and Raku diagnoses Haru with a cold after touching her neck. Haru initially refuses his help, but Raku reminds her that Kosaki would hate to see her sister suffer, so she relents. Raku serves her some rice porridge (which is 'disgusting', but she eats all anyway) and sports drink and leaves her to rest. Whilst resting, Haru's fever worsens, but Raku puts a cold compress on her forehead and waits by her side until she wakes up, which wakes up and he gets up hurriedly to change Kosaki's compress, which causes Haru to chuckle and smile. Once she feels better, Haru hands Raku the pendant of her 'Prince Charming', with the assumption that he will help her find said 'Prince Charming'.

                    Chitoge's birthday is coming up and she quizzes Raku to see if he remembers, only for him not to, but does recall other events that happened around the same time. This understandably irritates Chitoge, who hates herself for flipping out and is determined to apologise (even though this time she was in the right), while Raku is also determined to apologise, as he does remember that Chitoge's birthday is soon, but only after she left the classroom. Neither get to apologise any point of the day, as Chitoge's frustration ends up being too much of a barrier for both. As they leave school, a stray baseball comes hurtling towards Chitoge, but hits Raku square on the forehead, as he tries to push Chitoge to safety. Raku gets up, but doesn't remember anyone of himself.

                    A consultation with a doctor reveals no signs of any brain damage and Raku should get his memories back eventually, so the gang gather in a park to decide what to do. They 're'-introduce themselves, with a few (Shu and Marika) letting their selfishness over-complicating things to leave Raku with a poor impression of himself. They decide it is best not to send Raku back to his home, so Chitoge volunteers, out of guilt, to take him home to her house.<br/>
                    After sneaking in and heading into Chitoge's bedroom, Raku asks what kind of boyfriend is he and why Chitoge is in love with him, with Chitoge's responses making him incredibly bashful. This it is too much for her and she dashes out of her room, leaving Raku to look at his pendant and struggling to remember its significance to himself.

                    After looking at his pendant, Raku begins to remember a girl, but can't get any further than that. Chitoge returns and asks if there any objects that could jog his memory, but before he can answer she realises that Raku doesn't have anywhere to sleep, so she takes Raku to a spare room, but when she goes on ahead to check the coast is clear, Claude spots Raku and is normally aggressive self, despite Raku's politeness. Chitoge spots this and drags Raku back to her room, where he ends up sleeping in (a partition is built to separate the 2).<br/>
                    The next day, the gang decide to try recreate first encounters, so Chitoge vaults the school perimeter wall and knees Raku in the face, but it doesn't work. Kosaki declines to recreate her first encounter, as it too violent, but Seishiro has no qualms, but it still doesn't help. A strategy meeting at Kosaki's house is called and with no solution being suggested, Marika begins to rummage around Kosaki's room where she finds a book which piques her interests.<br />
                    The bonus comic for this volume continues following the adventures of Magical Confectioner Kosaki, where we are introduced to a new magical girl: Magical Police Marika.
