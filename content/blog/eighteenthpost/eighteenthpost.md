    Hello all!<br />
    This is the third update to the Card Game Player Project and this week I've been finishing the other SupportCard classes.<br />
    As always, the entire project is available at this GitHub repository: <a href="https://github.com/CulverT01/cardgameplayer">https://github.com/CulverT01/cardgameplayer</a>

    I have tested the Player, CreatureCard, SupportCard1 and SupportCard2 classes' behaviour methods with Card and SupportCard classes not being tested as they have no methods apart from Getters and Setters. All tests have passed, with the alterations in order to make sure those tests pass being listed in the Changes and Clarifications section

    <h2 class="row">Changes and Clarifications</h2>
    <p class="col-8">
    In order to make my life easier, I have changed SupportCard1 and SupportCard2 classes, so they include an integer attribute called strength, which will be the number that card's effect increases the attack of. This also applies to other SupportCard classes that will use a number as a part of their effect, so one class can represent 2 or 3 Support Cards rather than 1.
