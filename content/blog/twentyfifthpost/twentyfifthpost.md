                This is my review of Nisekoi Volume 8. After re-reading the first 7 volumes has made me want to watch the Nisekoi anime agian, which is convenient as this is the first volume to be printed and released (in Japan) after the annoucement that the series would get an anime. Volume 7 had been released after the annoucement, but it would've been a few weeks at most given that Volume 7 was released 4th June 2013 and the anime was annouced on 27th May 2013.

                    Shu has decided to hold his Christmas party again, because apparently the party was no fun without Chitoge and Raku, but the reason is the entire class wants all details about Raku and Chitoge's hotel stay the day prior. At the party, everyone starts looking at the couple suspiciously and when Raku talks Marika and Kosaki, they run away or can't look him in the eye directly. A couple of the female classmates ask Chitoge for some details, which she provides, but not clearing up misunderstanding that they did the 'deed'. The misunderstanding is quickly cleared up after a male classmate asks directly and out loud for the details of their night together. <br />
                    On the walk home from the party, Chitoge asks Raku what her mother (Hana) and he talked about at the airport as they saw her off, which is revealed via flashback. The conversation was Hana revealing that she had worked out that 2 were fake dating, although not initially, and asks if his feelings towards Chitoge were just as fake, while he asks if she knew anything about his pendant which she doesn't, but remembers that it was in Chitoge's favourite picture book - whilst on her flight out of Japan. Raku decides not to tell Chitoge anything about this conversation - maybe Hana was closer to the mark about his feelings towards Chitoge than he likes?.

                   Raku is annoyed that his dad has roped him into helping out at nearby shrine on New Years Eve, but cheers up after seeing Kosaki in a shrine maiden (everyone else was there, but they don't move needle for Raku like Kosaki does). The priestess who runs the shrine gathers the girls together to alert them that Raku is being haunted by an evil demon, and if they don't exorcise it before the year is up then his life is in danger. They all take this news gravely seriously because the priestess is really famous medium that once saved the town from a crisis[<i>citation needed</i>]. The best exorcism method is to strike Raku with the temple's bell striker, but the girls wish to try less violent methods, so the priestess comes up with a talisman to be stuck onto Raku in a place nearest to the Daitan and where evil waste is excreted (the butt) and this fails. The second is to get one of them to hug Raku for a minute, as the shrine maiden clothing is imbued with exorcising power, only it does nothing. The final attempt is to get Raku to drink some holy water via mouth to mouth, but this just ends up with Raku being chased into the bell striker, thus exorcising the demon.

                    Raku is awoken by the gang arriving at his house on New Years Day, with only him not knowing about it. Whilst entertaining his guests, Chitoge asks if he has anything sweet to eat, Raku searches the kitchen and finds some chocolates and gives them to her which she takes and passes them around everyone else. Later, Chitoge comes over to Raku asking to kiss him and he taken aback by this, but notices her face is red. He checks the wrappers for the chocolates and it turns out that they were Whiskey Bonbons and Chitoge is drunk. Raku tries to get Shu to help, only for him to be attacked by a drunk Marika, whilst Seishiro also goes in for a kiss, like Chitoge, but luckily Raku manages to switch himself out for a small animal statue. He then encounters Ruri, who is just pessimitic, and Kosaki, who is 'too warm' and is trying strip. He escapes from that situation, only to be caught by Chitoge, who now asks him whether or not he likes her and if he say no, then she'll beat him up. Intrigued by this incitement of violence, the other girls want in and all 4 slowly close on Raku, who then faints. Raku eventually wakes up, but doesn't remember much beyond the girls closing on him and the girls collectively refuse admit anything happened.

                    The chapter begins with Raku's class's teacher deciding to change the seating arrangement of the class because she was supposed to do it last trimester but forgot. The arrangement is decided randomly and everyone is grouped together except Chitoge, who requests a do-over which the teacher agrees to. The new arrangement has Seishiro between Chitoge and Raku, but Marika can't sit where she has been assigned, so requests a do-over. More and more requests do overs, which eventually ends with Raku next Marika, but in an effort to get in his friend's good graces (and score a fast-food meal), Shu asks to switch with Raku (who is at the front) so he can see the board better and this puts Raku next to Kosaki. Their first lesson with this arrangement begins and Raku and Kosaki can't handle being near each other, which is made worse by the drawings that Shu and Ruri left in their textbooks, meaning they have to borrow someone else's textbook. Kosaki admits to being nervous around him now, but with time they'll get used to it. The teacher announces that they're changing seats again and this time Raku ends up between Chitoge and Kosaki, so now he gets the best of both worlds.

                    The chapter begins focussing on the three girls making valentine's chocolate (it is tradition in Japan for girls to give out chocolate on Valentine's Day). Kosaki has her sister talking through a chocolate cake recipe, which is going as well as you'd expecet; Chitoge is shaping some chocolate into a more and more horrifying blob each times she does; Marika is welding something. February 14th rolls around and Raku is secretly hoping that someone will give him some chocolate and Chitoge is likely candidate, but she only gives him attitude and Kosaki is no hope either. Raku spots Seishiro giving Shu some chocolate, as she beleieves that you give it to someone you hate, but Raku assumes the opposite. Marika appears with a large statue of Raku in chocolate and chases him down with it, Kosaki spots them and is motivated by Marika's tenacity to give her chocolate, but trips and crushes it, rendering it unpresentable to the boy she loves. The chapter ends with her eating it in tears.

                      Raku is looking for Kosaki where he encounters a blood-lust Seishiro, who is chasing Shu after she found out about the trick he pulled in the last chapter. Raku stops her to ask if she has seen Kosaki but she hasn't, so the conversation moves onto chocolate giving tradition of Valentine's day and misunderstandings on both sides are cleared up. Seishiro gives Raku some platonic chocolate and he is overjoyed as this is the first time a girl has ever given him chocolate on Valentine's day, before leaving whilst reminding her not to regift chocolate as a lot of effort and courage goes into giving the chocolate. Raku realises immediately how much of hypocrite he is and searches out Marika, who is crying over the remains of her Choco-Raku, as it has crashed into a wall. In order to clear his conscience, Raku begins to eat a chunk of the statue, ignoring Marika's protestations not to, but continues to do so as the chocolate is delicious. Chitoge finds Kosaki and asks about the chocolate that she has. Kosaki explains the chocolate before asking if Chitoge has any chocolate and the boy she'll be giving them to is Raku as she likes him.

                    The Chapter picks up from where the last one finished, with Chitoge denying that she is in love with Raku and would never give him any chocolate - including platonic chocolate. Chitoge then asks if Kosaki likes anyone and she replies that she does and han't told anyone except Ruri who that is. Chitoge gets Kosaki to agree to support her confessing to the guy she likes (Raku), while she will support Kosaki confessing to the guy Kosaki likes (Raku). They both head to the cookery classroom to make some more chocolate, (don't worry, Chitoge has spare ingredients that she brought to school as she thought she might be making chocolate last minute) which they do as school finishes for the day. Chitoge hands her <b>PLATONIC</b> chocolate to Raku and he calls it delicious, although this is a lie as it's later revealed that Chitoge used salt instead of sugar - don't ask. Kosaki hands Raku her chocolate just before he leaves school and he calls it delicous, although this is the truth and Kosaki reveals it to be platonic, but also a special kind of platonic.
