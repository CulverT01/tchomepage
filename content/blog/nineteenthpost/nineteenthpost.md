                   This is my review of Volume 5 of Nisekoi. When first reading this series, I remember not liking Marika Tachibana due to her brazen, homewrecking attitude towards Raku and his relationships with the other girls, that didn't respect his feelings. Maybe rereading the series may give me a chance to see the character in a different light. I'm also start going to refer to Onodera and Tsugumi by the first names (Kosaki and Seishiro) as they're the only main characters who I didn't before, but I won't change earlier reviews to reflect this change.

                    The chapter continues from the cliffhanger of last volume, with Marika asking Raku to dump Chitoge in exchange for information about the promise 10 years ago. Unfortunately for her, he won't do that and she respects his decision, but will not give him up to a girl who'll spy on private conversations like Chitoge. Chitoge appears from her hiding spot and begins to duel Marika in a game of verbal top trumps, based on their relationship with Raku. The game ends when Marika attempts to kiss Raku, which annoys Chitoge enough that she wallops Raku - I guess one of the founding principles of Beehive is to never hit a girl, as there is no other reason I can think of for targeting Raku rather than Marika. Chitoge storms off before Marika decides to take her leave, leaving Raku alone with her handbag and he goes out to try and find her to return it, overhearing that the statement about her frail constitution wasn't much of a lie. He returns the handbag whilst asking how she is and responds that she's fine and what he sees in Chitoge, as she believes that she is a rude and uncouth brute of a woman. Raku responds that she is worser than what Marika has said, but Chitoge can be nice on occasion and she has trouble expressing herself. He then mentions that he doesn't remember her, nor understands what she sees in him and this breaks Marika, who starts ranting in a US southern drawl (US equivalent of a Kyushu accent) of an accent, which Raku recognises and immediately remembers who she is.

                    Marika is embarrassed at being caught speaking unladylike, but as the language used caused Raku to remember her, she reveals their first meeting and the reasons why she looks and talks the way she does now. She isn’t upset anymore that Raku didn’t remember her, as she wants him to fall in love with the Marika of here and now, not 10 years ago. She gets him to lower his guard, kissing him on the cheek and then leaving. <br />
                    Sometime later at school, Raku gathers Kosaki, Chitoge and Marika and explains that they all met 10 years ago and the girls all have keys which relate to a promise he made with one of them, with Marika revealing that the promise is to get married to each other - or that is what both she and Raku promised. Marika didn’t know that there were other keys and other girls, so can’t comment on the promise that the others made, so only conclusion is that one key is real, the other keys are fake and Raku and Marika kissed (on the cheek). Marika and Chitoge continue to argue who is better for Raku, asking Kosaki if she likes Raku as well, to which she friends zones him. The final barb of the chapter comes from Chitoge as she reminds Marika that Raku forgot about her, causing her snap back in her native accent.

                    Marika invites Raku to meet her father to discuss the arrangements of their wedding, of which he does not consent to, but if he wants to call it off, he needs to talk to Mr Tachibana directly - so he does. Before entering her home, Raku asks Marika what her father is like and according to her, he dotes on her as well as being kind and gentle, but when Raku first meets him, he is absolutely petrified of him and is tense and nervous whilst during their talk. Raku, with input from Marika, explains the current situation between them. Midway through the conversation, Marika leaves to make tea, leaving the 2 men alone where Mr Tachibana reveals how much Raku means to her and he tells that he is not in love with his daughter, he has a girlfriend and he loves someone else. Mr Tachibana backs off on being hostile towards Raku, but still expects for him and his daughter to end up together. Upon Raku's exit, he is greeted by Marika, who asks how everything went, to which the answers are mostly positive. She then asks him what is attractive to him so she can change suit his desires, but he tells her that she is attractive as she is and she doesn't need to alter herself for him. However, this causes her to blush, lose composure (slipping into her accent) and then runs away.

                    The chapter starts with Ruri audibly lamenting to Kosaki that she has made no progress with Raku, only for Kosaki to sheepishly reveal that she has asked him to come over to her house and Ruri's reaction is hilarious. However, as revealed in a flashback, Kosaki has merely asked Raku to help at her family's Japanese sweet shop because they're short a member of staff and he is the only person she knows that can cook - he obviously accepts. <br />
                    He arrives at the shop only to be turned away by Kosaki's stressed out mother before Kosaki intervenes and explains his appearance. Mrs Onodera (Kosaki's mother) doesn't think much of Raku and will only let him work if he can prove his cooking prowess, to which he performs admirably enough to earn her blessing for his and Kosaki's possible future wedding. Mrs Onodera leaves them to handle the shop whilst she goes out chase up late arriving stock, during the making of the sweets Kosaki remarks that with her decorating skills and his ability to cook, the make an excellent Japanese sweet making team, to which he nearly takes as a proposal to marry and run the business together. Whilst working the till, Kosaki asks him if he goes on dates with Chitoge to which confirms only for her to tell him that she knows truth and he can drop the whole charade in front of her which is of great relief for him, but still doesn't answer the question of the photo he dropped in front of her in chapter 30. They note that weather is worsening outside, owing to a typhoon blowing through, then her mother calls the shop to let them know that Raku can stay night, due said weather. The back illustration is Mrs Onodera chuckling to herself over the fact her daughter and probable future son-in-law are spending the night.

                    Raku immediately asks if there will be anyone else coming home to which Kosaki responds with no, so Raku decides to head home and out into the storm before admitting defeat and stays at Kosaki's. They close up shop, in which Raku asks what they're going to do about food only to spot Kosaki absolutely joyous at current circumstances, but she blames it on a joke she remembered from a tv program she watched, before inviting him to her room to discuss food and he agrees. Realising what she has said, Kosaki quickly races up to her room to tidy up and change clothes before inviting him in. She asks him to wait while she makes some tea and, after calming himself, goes to look at a photo frame that she'd put face down, but she re-enters before he can have a good look at it (photo is of Raku, obviously). There's a moment of awkward silence, before Kosaki decides to play 20 questions and Raku's response is to get a photo album from their time at junior high school. They begin to reminisce about their time there and Kosaki mentions that Raku was really popular with girls, which he doesn't believe only for her to tell him that there was at least a girl who had a crush on him, but she won't say who as she doesn't have that girl's permission. Kosaki looks outside of the window as sees that it has stopped raining as the typhoon has moved away from Japan, so Raku decides it is time for him leave and she agrees, much to his disappointment, but before he leaves, he manages to ask to exchange phone numbers and she agrees. As he leaves, Kosaki types out a message revealing who the girl who had a crush on him in junior high school was, but deletes it and sends a message telling him she had fun and to have good night. She goes to sleep, proud of the bravery she showed and hopes Ruri will think the same, only for the back illustration to show the opposite.

                    Seishiro has arranged a study session with the gang at Raku's home in order to test out a lie detector given to her by Claude with intention of catching Raku lying about his feelings towards Chitoge. Seishiro suggests that Raku goes first, but pressure from Chitoge means that she goes first instead and is asked if she likes anyone. She denies this, but the machine says it is a lie and Seishiro continues to deny by stating that lie detectors aren't infallible and the question was too vague, so then is asked if she is in love with someone and the machine reacts the same as before. It's now Raku's turn in the hot seat and his first question is if he loves Chitoge, which he and the machine says it's true, but there's a difference of opinion on the second question: Is Chitoge the prettiest girl in the room. It's now Marika's go and she's asked if she and Raku have kissed, which is true according to her and the machine. Kosaki is interrogated next, so Shu asks if her cup size is a C (UK/US size B) and is swiftly punished for his actions, while Kosaki is told that she needs not to answer. Chitoge is next to be grilled and her question is if she and Raku have kissed, however she and the machine disagree. It swings back to Seishiro and Shu desperately wants to know if her cup size is E (UK/US size D) and again is swiftly punished, but Seishiro at least answers telling us that her boobs are not that big, although the machine says that is a lie. The final question for Seishiro is: between Raku and Shu, who does she prefer and she answers neither, which the machine disagrees to and thus ends the time spent with the lie detector. Later, when she is alone, Seishiro tries out the lie detector and says that she likes Raku, to which the machine doesn't respond. She takes this to mean that the statement is true only for Raku to walk by and tell her that the machine isn't plugged in which plunges her into a rage against the machine.

                    Raku and Chitoge are out on a walk, bickering as usual, when they find a puppy seemingly abandoned. Raku can't take him, as he's taken too many animals home with him and has subsequently been banned, School is closed so it's a no go and Chitoge already has a big dog and therefore can't either. They try to hold the puppy with it accepting Raku (a first for him), but rejecting Chitoge (the running gag for this chapter). They start asking round, beginning with Kosaki, who turns them down due to her family being in food business, before trying with Seishiro, who is absolutely enamoured with the puppy, however can't accept as she won't be home consistently enough to look after it. They ask Marika, who also refuses to take the puppy as her condo tenancy agreement forbids pets, still they ask around but get the same answer as before. This continues for a week with Chitoge temporarily looking after it, slowly bonding with the puppy, with 'Adopt Me' put up by the members of Shuei-Gumi. The puppy's true owner is eventually found and it is returned to them, meaning Chitoge has to say goodbye, but Raku treats her to some ramen due to how hard that was for her.

                    Raku has got some time off from working at a festival stall that his family runs, to go explore said festival and it ends up being a date with Chitoge as he runs into her, which complicates his plan to get a 'super ultra love' charm that is only available during the evening of this festival. While initially appearing to ruin Chitoge's evening, however Shuei-Gumi is operating a good number of stalls, so Raku can get food for free as well as various activities, one of which being goldfish scooping that Raku impresses Chitoge with his skill catching a rainbow carp - don't ask. Whilst walking around, Chitoge notices that all the other girls a in a yukata and wonders if she should be wearing one. The 'miracle-working turbo-charged must-have love' charms (same ones Raku wanted) are about be sold and Raku heads over to get one, along with everyone else in Japan it seems, as huge crowd begins gather around the love charm stall. In order to not lose her 'free pass' Chitoge holds Raku's hand, but as Raku get his charm, he loses Chitoge and ends grabbing Kosaki's hand instead.

                    The chapter continues from the last one with Raku and Kosaki leaving the crowd to find Chitoge. Whilst looking, one of the staps on Kosaki's sandals break, so Raku carries her to quieter area to fix it, only for a cat make off with his love charm. Raku then chases that cat, running into and charming Marika and Seishiro along the way, while the love charm also encounters Shu and Ruri, before ending in the hands of Chitoge, who has now changed into a yukata. She returns the charm to him, whilst asking how she looks and he responds that she looks great. Raku feels kind of weird that he has a charm primarily aimed at women, so hands it to nearest one, Chitoge, who becomes immediately flustered as she just read from a nearby signboard that a man giving a love charm to woman is equivalent to a marriage proposal. As confusion sets amongst the pair, Chitoge's obi (a sash worn around one's waist to keep the yukata in place) comes loose, exposing her naked body, because she thought you weren't supposed to wear underwear with your yukata but <b>YOU SHOULD. </b>As he trying to fix her yukata, Raku sees the signboard that Chitoge read from and immediately is embarrassed by his own actions and let the obi fall even further, much to Chitoge's horror.

                   The chapter begins with the gang at the beach as Shu's friend had to cancel a trip to there, but sold it Shu for a cheap price. Chitoge and Marika note this there first time at a Japanese beach, with the last time for Chitoge being North Carolina's coast and Marika being the Maldives - Celebrities am I right? The almost exclusively group of girls attract a lot of attention, but Raku is there to see off those who dare make a move on his 'fake' girlfriend. Marika wants Raku to apply suncream on her, but Chitoge is only too happy to oblige, but socks Raku when she allegedly catches him drooling over Marika. The gang decide who will be barbecuing and the honour falls upon the 'happy' couple Raku and Chitoge, the latter ends being really jumpy when they touch each other, owing to the events of the last chapter. Exhausted after doing the work of 1.5 people, Raku rests on a small pier whilst everyone else cleans up, before Kosaki comes over to talk to him, initially about Chitoge's sudden quietness, before moving onto how they'd never done this in junior high. Despite the conversation not being awkward, the 2 still run out of topics to talk about before Kosaki asks if she can kiss him, whilst Chitoge walks over to bring them back as they're heading to their accommodation and overhears what has just been said.
