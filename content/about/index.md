    I have experience with various programming languages, especially with Python, Java, and HTML. <br /> 
    I also have experience with various areas of Computer Science such as Web Development, Databases, Internet of Things, and Software Development.<br /> 
    I regularly help out at my local Beaver Scout Troop where I lead sections of meetings and assist the Beaver Scouts when they need help with the activities.
