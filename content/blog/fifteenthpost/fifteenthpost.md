                    This is my review of the Nisekoi Volume 3. The last one had alot less humor than the first, due to the lack of Shuei-Gumi members appearing in the volume, although Ruri did her upmost best trying to compensate for that. Hopefully this one will have more humor to it.

                    The chapter continues on from the revelation at the last volume that Seishiro Tsugumi is a girl. Raku realises the awkward situation he is in and immediately tries to rectify that by trying to dress Tsugumi before hiding the 2 of them in a locker as the entire class comes looking for them. Whilst they don't 'appear' to be in the locker room, the class continues to search as there is water on the floor. Tsugumi begins to open up to Raku as to why she dresses like she does and why she has a boy's name. Basically, Claude thought she was a boy, brought her as such and never changed his mind in the subsequent time since. Meanwhile, Raku is trying to keep his feelings in check, as he is in a tight space with a semi-naked girl who is incredibly cute and he tells her such as Chitoge finds them. Chitoge clobbers Raku, before he explains himself and if he had done before she did, then she would've stopped also Raku's misery doesn't end there as he has to write a letter of apology to the school for using the without permission. After he leaves, Tsugumi confesses Chitoge that Raku won and that she understands what he said about her, but still doesn't approve of him - is a tsundere attitude a part of the female Beehive culture or something? Chitoge gets Tsugumi to wear the female student uniform as a way of showing that she's a girl along with a ribbon in her hair, which Raku says looks super cute and immediately flusters her, so she changes back to her old uniform but still continues to wear the ribbon.<br /> There's an intermission for this chapter at the end which details the different outfits Tsugumi had to try on before settling for the school uniform and they get more revealing every time.

                    Tsugumi formally introduces herself to Onodera and Ruri to which Ruri reveals that she knew all along that Tsugumi is a girl, whilst showing immediate displeasure towards Shu as his addressing of Chitoge is far too rude for someone of his standing. She continues to hang around Chitoge, meaning Raku can't get too close to her - not that he minds. The club that Raku and Chitoge are a part of need to pick up some food for the animals because they have some rare animals that you can't just simply order in the food for, but your nearest pet store will stock such food. Tsugumi volunteers to go in Chitoge stead, but only after Chitoge puts her in a dress and takes her weapons away in order to make her more girlier, thus no one will mistake for a girl. The outfit that Chitoge picked out is so spellbounding that everyone, including Raku, ends up staring, much to Tsugmui's embarassment. On their way to the pet store, Tsugumi stumbles and Raku catches her, where it's revealed that Tsugumi's heels are her causing so much discomfort that it's easier for Raku to carry her rather than let her suffer. The 2 end up talking about crushes and seeing as neither have one, they discuss Chitoge instead whose first crush was a boy she met 10 years ago. Raku tells Tsugumi that alot of guys will crush on her due to her ability of total devotion, which really embarasses her.

                    Raku has gotten a cold, so Chitoge has gone to visit him as she is his girlfriend and that's what girlfriends do, but she feels partly responsible because the cold is probably from when he fell in the pool during his duel with Tsugumi. Chitoge tries to be nice to Raku, but this sudden change in behaviour freaks him out and they eventually end up arguing again. The war of words is interrupted by Onodera arriving to check on Raku, of which he is very appreciative of and that annoys Chitoge. Onodera volunteers to make some rice porridge and Chitoge decides to join in with Raku initally okay with, until he realises neither can cook and becomes even more terrified when listening to their 'cooking'. Their rice porridges come out looking excactly you'd expect and as Raku stalls, a Shuei-Gumi member called Dragon comes in with his own rice porridge only to take it away as soon as he sees Chitoge's porridge, much to Raku's despair. In the end, Raku decides to bite the bullets and downs both porridges, only for him to collapse and pass out; not recovering until the next morning, bar brief moment of semi-consciousness where he goes to hold the hand of a shadowy figure next to him which turns out to be Chitoge. <br />
                    At the back of the chapter, ther's an illustration of 2 members scoffing Dragon's rice porridge and commenting on how good it is, whilst he says it needs to thrown away due it not being needed.

                    Tsugumi has started to notice that her heart starts to race, her chest aches, her faces feels hot around someone and when around this person she can’t hardly speak - 3 guesses who it is. She consults Chitoge about it who tells her that she might have some kind of illness, but Tsugumi doesn’t feel ill so she seeks out a second opinion. She asks other people but either fail to give a straight answer or don’t know what she is talking about, however Onodera and Ruri tell that her symptoms are indicative of someone in love, but that is impossible for Tsugumi. As she wrestles with the truth, she returns to Chitoge and tells her about what she has learned, but Chitoge can’t help to confirm as she has never been in love. Tsugumi reminds her that she has, as she had crush on a boy 10 years ago but clearly Chitoge has forgotten. Tsugumi’s reminder does jog Chitoge’ memory, so she tries to find something she had around then that might jog it even further and she finds a diary she had when she was 5 years old - 10 years ago.

                    The chapter begins with Chitoge reading her diary from when she was 5. There details an event where she was attacked by a strag dog, but her crush back then saved but got a scar on his head for his troubles. After helping nurse him back to Chitoge, spent as much time as possible with her crush until she had to leave for the United States, but not before making a promise with her crush. The diary abruptly ends there, leaving her and the readers frustrated at her 5 year old self, however it does contain an old key that she decides to take as it might relate to the promise. Tsugumi interrupts her to ask she's okay as she's missed dinner and Chitoge responds whether or not Tsugumi remembers anything about her crush, but she doesn't, although any investigation will have to wait, as there's a class trip tomorrow.<br />
                    The trip begins will all the characters (bar Shu) sat on the backrow of seats of the coach in the order: Ruri, Onodera, Raku, Chitoge, Tsugumi. The journey to their destination consists of Ruri shoving Onodera into Raku at every curve, everyone else be damned. While the journey is considered a positive one by some, the instiagators (Shu and Ruri) are likely to retribution later. The class's first task on the trip is to make some curry and Raku takes charge of his group, knowing the cooking abilities of 2 of his groups members and during this task, Chitoge spills hot water on his head forcing him to reveal a scar on his forehead and Chitoge to reveal the key she found earlier in this chapter. <br />
                    I'll say this now, but Chitoge is an alright character when she's not trying to wind up Raku.

                    The chapter continues on from the last one and Chitoge asks Raku where his scar came from. He doesn't know, but assumes it's from an animal that scratched him becasue he used to play with them alot when he was younger. As this doesn't confirm or deny Chitoge's suspicions, she begins to continue her questioning only to realise that she could be his promise girl and that would be <i>like the worst!</i>. <br /> 
                    The action moves to the room in the inn they're staying, where Shu suggests playing a game of Old Maid with a penalty of revealing your first crush, a decision reached with some 'input' from Ruri, which no one wants to do, so thus they can't lose. There is one problem, some have obvious reactions and only after Raku mentions it, are poker faces deployed. The game ends with Raku and Chitoge facing each other, but the game is abandoned when their teacher brings them down for dinner. <br />
                    After dinner, the boys head to the hot springs to, although without Raku who's summoned to the front desk, as he has a phone call. No one answers when Raku picks up the call, so he heads to the hot springs, only for Claude to appear and switch the banners hanging over the entrance, meaning Raku has entered the women's bath rather than the men's. Raku realises this once he encounters Chitoge, who soon realises this predicament is Claude's doing after Raku defends himself, however before he can leave Onodera, Ruri and Tsugumi all arrive; making escape that more harder.<br />
                    The back illsustration is Chitoge, Tsugumi and Onodera trying to do their best poker faces.

                    Ruri and Onodera are preoccupied with teaching Tsugumi the proper etiquette with washing in a hot spring bath, so Raku heads towards a staff only door, whilst Chitoge will try to distract those who there by pointing out a raccoon dog. Unfortunatly, more girls enter the springs, including their teacher, upping the risk of Raku being caught, which he nearly is as Tsugumi throws a shampoo bottle at the wooden bucket Raku is hiding under. He insteads hides behind Chitoge, but she herself is cornered by 2 of their fellow classmates, who want know how for she and Raku have gone. She deflects by exclaiming that Tsugumi has a crush on someone, pushing the focus on her allowing Raku to escape through a hole he's found that is human sized and will head to the men's bath. Meanwhile, Tsugumi deflects her grilling by asking about Onodera's crush who, out of embarrassment, runs away and sits in front of Raku's exit hole. Chitoge tries to move Onodera out of the way, but in the resultant kerfuffle, kisses Raku's butt as he makes his escape. <br />
                    They meet up later, so Raku can apologise and Chitoge asks how much of her did he see and he responds that he didn't anything at all due the steam (lie). The chaptert ends back in their room with Shu going to spy on the girls whilst they sleep, only to be caught by Ruri immediately who hangs both he and an innocent Raku upside down outside their room.
