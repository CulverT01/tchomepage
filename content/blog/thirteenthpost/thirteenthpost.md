                    This is my review of the Nisekoi Volume 2. The chapters now are lot shorter and so the summaries will be smaller, as one of my personal criticisms with the last review was about how long some of those summaries ended up being.

                    The plot of the chapter is about a group study session at Raku's home, that is organised by Ruri Miyamoto (Onodera's friend who appeared in Volume 1, but). She has done this so Onodera has a chance to get close to the boy she loves: Raku Ichijo. However, Onodera isn't willing to flirt with a man that is spoken for, so she is tense around him and avoids his gaze. Ruri tries to get Raku to help Onodera with her homework, but Chitoge intercepts and helps instead, which annoys Raku but pleases her. Chitoge asks Onodera if she likes anyone, which she denies, and Citoge responds with a similar before backtracking because she has someone - Raku. Shu begins to tease the couple, but before he can do any damage, Raku pulls him away to set the record straight about him and Chitoge. Shu reveals he worked out about their fake relationship from the start and was just messing with him. He then asks if Raku's going to confess his feelings to Onodera, after all she has a crush on him. <br /> 
                    The Shuei-Gumi members continue to be the best source of comedy in this series with their welcome sign for Raku and his friends being the comedic highlight of the chapter.

                    The chapter continues on from the previous one with Raku and Shu arguing over whether or not Onodera has a crush on Raku, with the result being probably not. They return to the group before Shuei-Gumi members try to help further Raku's relationship with Chitoge by locking both of them in a storeroom. This mildly inconviences Raku but Chitoge is petrified, so he promises not leave her side, despite her tsundere protestations. In order to past the time he suggests talking and the first topic is Onodera. Raku praises Onodera a bit too much, but Chitoge is too dense to realise that he could be in love with her. The next topic is kissing, which inevitably leads to an argument in which Chitoge realises that she's no longer scared and attempts to get up only to fall on top of Raku. Luckily, they are saved by Claude opening the storeroom door, but leads to an awkard situation that sees Onodera run away, embarassed at what they could've been doing, and Claude, mad at what they could've been doing. <br /> 
                    At the end of the volume, there is a bonus comic that details an interaction between Ruri and Shu. Ruri asks Shu about Chitoge and Raku's relationships, as she has doubts about it, but he brushes them off by teasing her leading her to think that he's better off dead.

                    The chapter begins with Raku seeking out Onodera to clear up last chapter's misunderstanding, only for him to overhear a conversation between she and Ruri where he finds out that Onodera made a promise to a boy 10 years ago and has a key. Surely she can't be the girl who he made that promise 10 years ago that is far too convenient, besides that kind of thing was in fashion 10 years ago, so it could be anyone. Ruri's next scheme to get Raku and Onodera together involves some swim training for a practice meet the next day and Onodera is competing, but doesn't know how to swim, so Raku and Chitoge will teach her because a: he's her crush and b: she's really athletic. (Shu is also here being a peverted nuisance, so Ruri drags him away after every interaction he has). Chitoge is far too advanced a swimmer to be an effective teacher, so Raku alone must do it, but Onodera is too cute for him to handle, thus progress is slow. Onodera leaves to get some drinks and in absence of everyone else, Raku goes over to her stuff to see if the key she carried in fits inside his pendant.

                    Raku tries the key, only to find it doesn’t fit and on closer inspection it doesn’t look like the that she dropped back in volume 1. Then the girls return and inform him that he has the key to the girls changing room and proceed with necessary action by tying him up. Raku pleads his innocence, with only Onodera partially believing in him, but that is enough to convince the others to think the same. Ruri thanks Chitoge for allowing them to borrow her boyfriend, which triggers a delayed reaction from her, further fuelling Ruri’s suspicions about them. The practice meet begins and Raku and Chitoge bickering continue which culminate in him reminding her to stretch and she ignoring such advice. This ends up on backfiring on her she gets cramp in both her legs and begins to drown. Raku immediately jumps in to rescue her and brings her poolside before being informed that she isn’t breathing and mouth to mouth resuscitation is needed. As he moves in, Chitoge wakes up and responds how you’d expect - violently. Afterwards, Ruri tells Onodera to forget the boy she met 10 years ago and focus on her current love life, as the only thing she can remember about the boy is that he had a lock-shaped pendant which as we all know, were all the rage 10 years ago. Meanwhile Shu has got himself and Raku in trouble with Chitoge by calling her fat.

                    The chapter begins at lunch the next day with Chitoge moaning about Rakus's conduct during the swim meet. Onodera tells her that Raku actually saved her and immediately regrets her actions and resolves to apologise. Attempt 1 results in Raku assuming it is about the comments that Shu made the day previous and he critises her diet, which annoys her. Attempt 2 is based around getting Raku a gift, but Chitoge's agressive nature causes it to fail. Attempt 3 is again devolves around a misunderstanding this time around the mouth to mouth incident and that makes her mad. Chitoge retreats to Ruri and Onodera and complains about Raku, to which Ruri questions their relationship and that prompts Chitoge to confide the truth about their relationship before leaving. Now knowing the truth about Raku and Chitoge's relationship, Onodera resolves to confess her feelings.

                    The chapter picks up from the cliffhanger of last chapter, with Onodera frantically trying to explaining to the old key before immediately running away. Raku buys her excuses because, as previously established, she's not her pendant girl. The chapter continues onto a new day in which Chitoge and Raku are exhausted from keeping up their act and Raku suggests that she tells a close friend to lessen the pressure, to which she storms off angrily. Raku is annoyed by her reaction and vents to his close friend, Shu, about this and he responds by mentioning that she may not have any close friends as Raku is the only one she has actually spent time with. <br />
                    Raku goes to find Onodera to set the record straight about his and Chitoge's relationship, only to find that she's gone home. Dejected, he plans to head home only to hear some students talking about Chitoge and how hard it is to approach her, so he changes his mind and finds her instead. When he finds her, he catches her writing notes in a book about her fellow students' interests. She's embarrassed about it, but it is necessary due to Cluade's overprotectiveness and this confession causes Raku to realise how similar their upbringing has been and he confesses he did the same thing before and volunteers to help her with her notes, which much to her chagrin, she accepts. The conversation ends, as usual, in an argument which the admit that their relationship is a lie and this overheard by Onodera.
