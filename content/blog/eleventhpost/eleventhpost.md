                    When deciding what my first Manga series I should review, mind went to the first series I ever bought - Nisekoi. I started buying this series after I had seen the anime and wanted to see how it ends and began buying the series when I was about 16. I have read and enjoyed the entire series, so this review series will allow me to look back on the series and see if overall opinion of Nisekoi changes.

                    The chapter starts with a scene set 10 years prior to the present in the manga where 2 kids, a boy and a girl, promise to marry over pendant with a lock in it by saying 'Zawsze in Love' which means 'Forever in Love'.The boy turns out to be Raku Ichigo, the male lead for this series, who is the heir to the yakuza syndicate (japanese mafia) Shuei-Gumi. However, Raku doesn't want to inherit this instead graduating from university and becoming a civil servant. From the opening pages we learn that Raku is more a lover than a fighter, owing to his execellent cooking skils and lack of fighting prowess. Good job he's the protagonist of a rom-com series rather than an action one. We also learn about the Ichijo family creed, whose first two rules are: 'Never turn yer back on yer enemies.' and 'Always brush yer teeth.' therefore, basic hygiene ranks above loyalty and that makes me chuckle a bit. <br />
                    The story then moves onto Raku's school where we are introduced to 3 other characters: Shu Maiko, Kosaki Onodera, and Chitoge Kirisaki. They are Raku's best friend, his crush and the girl who knees him in the face. Shu is girl-crazy and heavily interested if there are hot girls around, while Onodera is very caring towards Raku, which he certainly likes, and nice towards everyone. Raku doesn't like what Chitoge did and she doesn't like his overreaction to the whole incident, so they naturally hate each other. Unfortunately, as Chitoge is half-American, half-Japanese and is new to Japan, thus needs someone help settle in at school and who better than Raku. As 'punishment' for kneeing him earlier, Raku enlists Chitoge to help find his pendant (the one from the start) that was lost when they collided with each other. <br />
                    When they not searching for the pendant we see some interactions between Chitoge and Raku such as: Them arguing how best take care of the animals the school have, Raku giving Chitoge some notes on Japanese class (which she struggles with) and Raku asking why Chitoge transferred in the middle of the year to which she dismisses the question. However day 7 of their search, Chitoge whines that some of the girls in their class think that they're dating and the notion of which annoys her, they're never going to find the pendant, someone has proably found the pendant and thrown it away as they think it is rubbish and Raku is a loser for caring so much about that pendant just beacuse some girl long ago gave it to him. The final statement pushes Raku over the edge and he loses his temper and tells her to quit if she feels that way, so she does. It also inexplicably starts raining for reasons. Raku continues to search for the pendant, but to no avail until Chitoge throws it at him because she found it and they're not speaking. Raku then wonders if Chitoge is right and should give up on the promise he made with that pendant, only for Onodera to tell him not to because the girl who made promise may still remember and that girl would sad if she found out that he had done that. But what does she know, it's not like she's the girl who made the promise 10 years ago anyway.<br />
                    The chapter ends with Raku returning home only for his father to call him to a meeting where, in order to prevent an all-out gang war between Shuei-Gumi and new gang that has moved in, he is to become lovers with the daughter of the boss of the rival gang who is Chitoge Kirisaki - the girl he's been feuding with at school. At the back of the chapter, there is an illustration which shows a alligator with Chitoge asking if the animal was abandoned, to which Raku confirms saying it was found in a cardboard box like an abandoned kitten. This got a chuckle out of me.

                    The chapter picks up after the end of chapter 1 in which Raku's father introduces his son to Chitoge and her father, Adelt Kirisaki-Wagner, who is the leader of the Beehive Gang - the new gang that moved in. Chitoge and Raku immediately dismiss the entire concept of them dating, even if it is 'pretend', due to them loathing each other. Their complaints are ignored and before they can protest any further, the Beehive gang burst in demanding that Shuei-Gumi return Chitoge because they believe Shuei-Gumi have kidnapped her. Before an all-out battle can begin, the 2 bosses reveal that their children and in love with each other and they support the relationship. The Shuei-Gumi boys are overjoyed at the news that Raku has a girlfriend, while Claude, the top executive at Beehive, is happy to see Chitoge grow up into a woman. The 2 gangs immediately start grilling the couple whose answers, no matter how terrible, are enough to convince them that they are really in love. <br />
                    Raku and Chitoge get some time alone which allows them reflect on their current situation. Raku thanks Chitoge for finding his pendant in the previous chapter and she responds by asking the story behind it. He explains the story behind it to which she gives a positive opinion on it, which is nice change from all the insults she tends to throw his way. The chapter finishes on a new day with Chitoge appearing at Raku's asking if he wants to go out on a date, of which neither has any choice in the matter. The back illustration is a gorilla singing a japanese folk song into a banana, which is a reference to answers Raku gave during the cross-examination in this chapter, and I found this funny.

                    The chapter follows Chitoge and Raku's date of which both are moaning about that their first date is with the other. Chitoge decides to leave only to spot a member of Shuei-Gumi and she and Raku realise that can't get out of this date. Chitoge demands that Raku takes the lead, as he is a man, so he brainstorms on what he would do on a date with Onodera (his crush, remember) and uses this as his plan for the date. Naturally, Chitoge acts the complete opposite to his fantasy with the date activities culminating in her kicking him after he tried to hold her hand. Raku tries to defend his actions, but Chitoge dismisses his defence and another war of words begin finishing with her ordering him to get her a drink. <br />
                    After he leaves, a group of guys appear and start to hit on her, but she tells that she waiting for someone and begins to ignore them. Unfortunately, as those guys didn't hear no, they continue to hit on her so she decides to hit on them, physically. Before she can do this, Raku arrives drags her away to a park, before chastising her for not being selective with her battles. Some more arguing occurs and Chitoge leaves for the toilet and while she's away, Raku wishes out loud that he wanted to be on a date with Onodera, when speak of the devil, Onodera appears.

                    The chapter continues where 3 finished off but instead on focussing on Raku's and Onodera's conversation, it instead focusses on Chitoge leaving the toilet and overhearing members of Beehive questioning hers and Raku's love. To remedy this, she decides to turn up the lovey-dovey, not realising that Onodera is there and now has to continue the act in front of a classmate. Raku however, decides to deny all possiblility of them being in a romantic relationship which annoys Chitoge, so she storms off. Onodera tells Raku that he shouldn't deny his and Chitoge's love, but before Raku goes after Chitoge he asks if she's seen his pendant before, preferably when she was younger, to which she denies. <br />
                    This means without a doubt Onodera cannot be Raku's pendant girl even though she has an old key that would probably fit inside the lock on his pendant. Raku finally catches up with Chitoge and apologises along with a gift of Dorayaki. Dorayaki are japanese confection that takes 2 small pancakes made from castella, squishes them together and has a sweet azuki bean paste filling. The chapter ends with Onodera arriving home where it's revealed that she lied to Raku, so she could be his pendant girl but can't tell him for obvious reasons that are obvious. At the back of the chapter are two 4-panel manga strips; the funniest being about the names Raku has given to some of the animals he takes care of.

                    The chapter begins with a scene between a young Raku and his mystery pendant girl in which he changes the ending to a book she's reading from a sad one to a happy one, but before she can say her name, Raku wakes up to reveal it was a dream. He's still upset over the events that happened in chapter 4, specifically those relating to Onodera, and on his way to school he meets up with Chitoge, who looks drained because members of Beehive wouldn't stop asking her about the date. They now both share a mutual exhaustion to the whole situation and are least thankful that only Onodera knows and Raku can set her straight anyway, so they don't have to keep up the charade at school.<br /> 
                    However, it turns out that Onodera wasn't the only one who spotted them out on their date, as Itano and Jogasaki (2 of their classmates) also spotted them and has told the entire class and now Raku and Chitoge are being lauded as a happy couple. Raku tries to deny this but before he has chance to he spots Claude and realises that they can't deny their relationship as it would jeopardise the peace that their relationship provides. The day passes by and Raku doen't get to talk to Onodera at all due to Claude constantly watching him in order to catch him being unfaithful to Chitoge, but luckily he does catch her at the end of the day after her student government meeting as the school is autonomous and independent from Japan to need its own government. He attempts to set the record straight, but decides against it because the truth could be construed as an admission of love, which he isn't ready to admit to her, so instead he plays down the compatibility between him and Chitoge which she rightly chastises him for because, in her eyes, it is obvious why Chitoge loves him. <br />
                    The chapter ends with someone bumping into Onodera, who then drops an old key. The back of the chapter has 2 more 4-panel manga strips, which follow on from the ones seen at the end of chapter 4. The funniest being Chitoge trying to give some of the animals names.

                    The chapter picks up from the cliffhanger of last chapter, with Onodera frantically trying to explaining to the old key before immediately running away. Raku buys her excuses because, as previously established, she's not her pendant girl. The chapter continues onto a new day in which Chitoge and Raku are exhausted from keeping up their act and Raku suggests that she tells a close friend to lessen the pressure, to which she storms off angrily. Raku is annoyed by her reaction and vents to his close friend, Shu, about this and he responds by mentioning that she may not have any close friends as Raku is the only one she has actually spent time with. <br />
                    Raku goes to find Onodera to set the record straight about his and Chitoge's relationship, only to find that she's gone home. Dejected, he plans to head home only to hear some students talking about Chitoge and how hard it is to approach her, so he changes his mind and finds her instead. When he finds her, he catches her writing notes in a book about her fellow students' interests. She's embarrassed about it, but it is neccessary due to Cluade's overprotectiveness and this confession causes Raku to realise how similar their uprbringing has been and he confesses he did the same thing before and volunteers to help her with her notes, which much to her chagrin, she accepts. The conversation ends, as usual, in an argument which the admit that their reltionship is a lie and this overheard by Onodera.
