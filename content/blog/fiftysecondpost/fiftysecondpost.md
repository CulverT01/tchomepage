    This is my seventh update to my Alternative Formula E Points Format project. There are no programming changes in this updates, so this update focus squarely on the results Season 11 of Formula E which finished last Sunday 27th July. I will be doing this for Season 12, which will begin on 6th December 2025 for Sao Paulo ePrix; assuming that event is still going ahead - this is Formula E, events that look like sure-fire things can easily suddenly be not.<br/>

    <h3 class="row">Overall Drivers' Championship</h3>
    <p class="col-8"> 
    The champion of Season 11 is Oliver Rowland and he remains so under the alternative format, with him scoring 184 points in real life and 189 points under the alternative format. He seals title initially for about 50 minutes as after the conclusion of the 2nd Berlin race, a 10 second time penalty for Nico Mueller means Pascal Wehrlein finishes 15th, reducing the points gap to 45 with 46 still up for grabs. The title is therefore definitely sealed during Semi-Final 2 of the Qualifying Duels for the first London race as Mitch Evans knocking Pascal out means the latter can't score the point for pole and is eliminated.<br/>
    No driver scores less or equal points with the alternative format compared to real life. The Driver who gains the most points under the alternative format is Robin Frijns, who scores 53 more points compared what he scored in real life - 76 points under the alternative format compared to 23 in real life. <br/>
    The driver who gained the most positions compared to their final standings in real life is Robin Frijns, who gains 3 places to finish 16th respectively under my alternate format as opposed to 19th in real life. The drivers who lose the most positions compared to where they finished under Formula E's current format are: Jake Dennis, Maximilian Guenther, and Lucas Di Grassi who all fall 3 places to finish 10th, 13th, 20th respectively under the alternative format compared to 7th, 10th, 17th respectively in real life. Their points totals under the alternative format are 110, 99, 48 respectively and compares to their real life points total which are: 93, 85, 32 respectively. Jake and Maximilian can blame unreliability, which is often not their fault, while Lucas can blame the alternative format awarding points for 11th to 15th and less points for 2nd, meaning his podium in the Miami ePrix is worth less and other competitors can slowly chip away at the points gained from that great finish. Mitch Evans is famous during this season for his 11 race streak of not scoring points, although the streak is slightly smaller under the alternative format, as it is 9 races instead.<br/>

    <h3 class="row">Customer Trophy for Drivers</h3>
    <p class="col-8">
    Taylor Barnard wins this championship whilst in the garage, as Dan Ticktum makes mistakes across the 2 London races (a DNF in race 1 and two 5 second time penalties in race 2) and cannot capitalise. Despite tying with Dan Ticktum in the overall Drivers' standings, Jake Dennis has to settle for 4th in the Customer Trophy for Drivers due to unreliability that has plagued him and his team all season, especially early on. Another driver I want to spotlight, although not for good reason, is David Beckmann as he is so off the pace compared to everyone that it takes until the first London race for him to break triple digits and to achieve his first class podium.<br/>

    <h3 class="row">Nelson Piquet Jr Trophy</h3>
    <p class="col-8">
    Like with the Customer Trophy for Drivers, Taylor Barnard wins this one, sealing it with 2 rounds to go, even before Mueller's 10 second penalty. While there was initially a 40 point gap between him and Nico Mueller; Taylor had more 3rd places, so even if Nico won the class in the 2 races in London and Taylor didn't finish either race, the 2 would have the same number of 1st and 2nd places (7 and 3 respectively). Another bad performer is once again Jake Hughes, as like with the Season 10 Nelson Piquet Jr Trophy championship, non-scores scuttle his chances of a good championship finish, meaning he finishes behind worser drivers (David Beckmann) and drivers in worser equipment (Zane Maloney).<br/>

    <h3 class="row">Overall Teams' Championship</h3>
    <p class="col-8">
    TAG Heuer Porsche wins this championship with 283 points from Mahindra Racing who have 243 points. Only Jaguar TCS Racing fail to score more than they did in real life, but even then the difference is minimal as it only 2 points (boom and bust points scoring doesn't work with points system that give more value to consistent results). There is a change of positions in the final standings under my alternate points format compared to real life as Mahindra swap places with Jaguar to finish 2nd, so Jaguar finish 4th. Only 6 times under the alternative format does a Mahindra car fail to finish inside the points and the team never fail to score points which is something Jaguar can't claim.<br/>
    Below are the Teams' Championship standings:

    <h3 class="row">Customer Teams' Championship </h3>
    <p class="col-8">
    Unlike with the other BTCC exclusive championships, this one ends up being a close one in the end, as 3 points separate the 4 teams. For a while it looks like Andretti are about perform a major upset, with Jake Dennis leading the customer class and the Mclaren drivers retiring from the race, as Andretti would tie with McLaren, but would take the title on countback due having more 2nd places in the class. However, a late race pass by Sebastien Buemi on Jake ends that dream and McLaren claimed another title in the garage. Can you believe that the team that won the Customer Teams' Championship and employed the driver who both the Nelson Piquet Jr Trophy and the Customer Trophy for Drivers will not be on the grid next year as no one wanted to buy the team.<br/>

    <h3 class="row">Manufacturers' Cup</h3>
    <p class="col-8">
    Stellantis wins the cup with 373 points from Porsche, who has 358 points, also all bar Porsche and Nissan score more points under the alternate points format than in real life. Only Nissan and Lola are in the same position in the championship as they are in real life. The explanations for why there is such is difference is down to less points for the top 2 positions which hurt Jaguar and Nissan, the difference between the alternative format's and Formula E's is that customer team entrants can't score points for a manufacturer (which differs from real life where they can) so that hurts Porsche, the 2 Stellantis brands count (DS and Maserati) as one therefore Stellantis has 4 horses in the race compared to everyone's 2 and it takes more to go wrong for them to have a bad result. <br/>
