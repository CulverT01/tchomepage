                    This is my review of Volume 2 of If Witch Then Which?. We see Miyu and Hikaru in colour at the start of this volume and Hikaru's hair colour is what you expect (blonde with a bit of orange so it's not simply yellow), but Miyu's hair colour is a light blue and it really doesn't suit her as shade of grey given suggests a darker colour or shade.

                    The chapter starts with a flash forward with Haruka in a communal bath surrounded by his classmates and all are naked. We then move to few hours earlier, where our protagonists and their class are being taught how to manipulate water. We don’t see any attempts by Maruna and Haruka as he spends too much time teasing her and they are interrupted when Miyu casts a mist illusion on them, which gives then the appearance of having cat ears and, in the case if Haruka, a cat mouth but do not exist and one’s hand can move through them (Haruka takes advantage of this). Meanwhile Hikaru in a conversation with a fellow classmate who reveals that AMD (a legendary post-bath item) is now available to purchase from the school shop. This excites all that overhear it, except Haruka and Maruna, as the former doesn’t care and the latter doesn’t know.<br/>
                    It is now the evening, around 9:30pm, so the communal baths are practically empty and Haruka can take a bath without the risk of spotting naked women or being spotted by naked women. Maruna acts as sentry to prevent anyone getting in and spotting Haruka sans wig. Unfortunately, Maruna fails to do her job properly as she heads to the loo, so a group of girls (including all characters that we have a name for) enter the baths and Haruka is forced to hide in the Sauna. Maruna quickly enters the baths and announces to everyone that she is going to be doing some spirit training in the sauna and she is not to be disturbed. In the sauna, she meets up with Haruka and discuss how to get out of the bath without anyone knowing he’s a guy and without he seeing any naked girls.<br/>
                    The plan is for Maruna to use mist illusions on Haruka and everyone else, giving him feminine features and everyone else is a cat according to Haruka’s eyes. This begins to work, however, Saki prevents him from leaving because he is not following proper sauna etiquette by cooling off. She also tries to cool off Maruna, who has also left the sauna, but this begins to lower her blood pressure and the illusions begin to fade so Haruka forces her into a bath to heat her up. He then continues to try to leave but is caught by Hikaru and is brought into a bath for a conversation, Haruka is cornered within the bath and Maruna is beginning to lose consciousness. Running out of time and options, Haruka is saved by some girls entering the bath announcing that the "Amazing Milky Drink" (AMD) is back in stock so everyone dashes out (except Haruka and Maruna) to procure some. As he breathes a sigh of relief, Haruka is spooked by a fellow student who says “bold as brass” and that Maruna has fainted. Haruka isn’t sure what she meant by “bold as brass” and carries Maruna out of the bath but can’t thank his fellow student as she has disappeared.<br/>
                    Maruna isn’t pleased that Haruka has seen her naked again, although this is partly her own doing as she failed to put an illusion or herself. Meanwhile Haruka is more concerned that the school might be haunted.

                    The class is individually (or together if you’re Haruka and Maruna) making good-luck tea which is to be served to a mandragora that is contracted with the school. The mandragora is elderly and doesn’t have enough magic power to kill people, also, in this universe, mandragora are unlucky species so need as much good luck as possible - hence the tea. Saki announces that if a mandragora is happy, a flower will bloom on its head and asks if any first year has achieved that feat. Ms Chloe responds that she doesn’t believe anyone has, so Saki announces that she will be the first. Everyone heads to the mandragora, who is called Yamane, with their tea for it to begin drinking it. Saki’s goes down excellently, while everyone else’s tea goes down fine - except Haruka and Maruna’s tea. Their tea isn’t even tasted by Yamane as they knock the tea cup away, disgusted by it and refuses to elaborate upon as to why. Haruka stands up for himself and Maruna’s attempt and manages to negotiate another attempt.<br/>
                    The 2 begin to work out what went wrong and Haruka theorises that it is due to the amount of magic power. This confirmed when he tastes the tea that he and Maruna made, along with some tea Miyu and Hikaru have made as they all taste the same, but magic is the hardest thing him to work out - he has no magic. Hikaru suggests asking Ms Chloe, but they’ve tried that and she was no help, so Miyu suggests someone else that could help. Haruka tracks down Saki to ask her for advice and is eventually told that what was wrong with their tea was that it was mostly likely poison. Haruka returns and Maruna reveals some more facts about being a witch, which is that is the herbs and plants they have to deal with are often poisonous, so incorrect measurements are deadly. This gives Haruka the solution he needs and tells Maruna they are going to make 10 types of tea. They return to Yamane with their 10 brews and asks for him to select the one he wants. He selects number 10, which is the most amazing good-luck tea any mandragora could have, as demonstrated by the flower on his head blooming. Haruka explains that that number 10 was cut with so much water that 5% of the liquid in the cup was actually tea and that what they had initially tried to serve to Yamane was so full of magical power, it was actually toxic.

                    As a reward for making an exquisite cup of good-luck tea, Maruna receives a freshly plucked mandragora root which is a key ingredient in a love potion. Later, over lunch, Hikaru asks if Maruna has made love potion yet, to which the answer is no. Haruka destroys the argument for a love potion with the logical fact that it just creates a falsified love, which goes against a key principle of witches - their power comes from love. Miyu counters that it could be used for a case of unrequited love and could be a way to get the other person to know your true feelings. Hikaru and Maruna start quiz Miyu, as they believe she is speaking from experience while Haruka finishes his food and begins to leave. Unfortunately, Hikaru won't let him leave until she know what his type is. Maruna answers for him, stating that he is into adults so Haruka responds that Maruna has no need for a love potion and she is in love with no-one and no-one loves her, also she probably fail at making the potion anyway.<br/>
                    This last statement riles Maruna so she decides to make the potion but upon competition, there is an explosion and when Haruka arrives to investigate, Maruna is acting all lovey-dovey towards him. If you were wondering why Haruka, well that is because he was on her mind and that influenced the potion. Unfortunately, the book which contains the way undo the potion's effect is damaged in the key areas and even worse, Maruna isn't the only one as seemingly everyone else breathed in the potion and now have the hots for Haruka. Haruka takes off with Maruna and are given sanctuary by Miyu, but she too is under the potion's influence so they head to Ms Chloe, who is also under the potion's spell. Haruka tries to take advantage of the situation to solve the problem, but Maruna pulls him away before he could get a proper answer as all he gets is "A Witches' power is love". The 2 are surrounded, so Haruka asks Maruna to use her magic to get them to fly, but she will only do so if he kisses her. He hesitate as he doesn't believe it would raise her blood pressure, so she kisses him instead and they (and everyone else) begin to float, but they manage to making to the P.A room.<br/>
                    After Haruka locks themselves inside the room, Maruna asks why he doesn't pay attention to her and if he likes her, before confessing her feelings. Haruka convinces himself that these are not Maruna's true feelings, despite how lucky he feels, which allows him to work out the solution. He turns on the announcer and confesses to the whole school and Maruna that he loves them. This cancels the potion's effect as like he presumed earlier during lunch, the potion creates a false love, so only true love can break it.<br/>
                    No one affected remembers the time whilst they were affected, but feel awkward around Haruka, like they did something embarrassing. Haruka reveals why he was so dead set against Maruna making the love potion, as she has him and needs no one else - to serve her as the love potion is just a mind control potion. This angers Maruna, so everything is back to normal.

                    Tonight is Walpurgis Night, a Witches' event that used to be for warding off evil spirits of winter and to welcome in spring but now is more of a celebration. The academy celebrates this night by way of reflection on how far each person has grown regarding their abilities as a witch. This is done by having every one dress up in special robes, gather in a courtyard, raise a glass filled with water to the moon where, with a little bit of magic, memories from the past year will appear in your glass. Maruna is struggling to get any memories to play, despite Haruka's assistance, so Miyu suggests sticking an item the glass to help. Maruna runs off to get an item and Haruka follows, only for Maruna to be grabbed another student - the same one which disappeared like ghost in the communal bath and the same one which saved the pair when Haruka fell of the broom. They deduce that she is the prodigy witch that everyone has been talking about and she introduces herself as Oboro Kurokami. Time is of the essence for Oboro, so she briefly explains that there is a room that only appears on Walpurgis Night and that room used to be her mother's lab, who disappeared along with her lab on a Walpurgis Night 10 years ago. The academy considers the matter settled, but it isn't for Oboro, so she intends to find out the truth and Maruna is willing to help her. Haruka is less willing, but Oboro silences his objections by patting down his chest and saying "fake boobs", which briefly panics Haruka into believing that she knows the truth before remembering that it is public knowledge that he pads his bra.<br/>
                    They enter the room and to find it spotless and tidy, but that only lasts briefly as Oboro starts pulling books off shelves to find any answers written down in them. Whilst looking around, Maruna accidentally knocks into an aquarium (a thin vase full of water, but that's the word the translators went with) but then spilled water along with all of the removed books return to the original places. Haruka then notices a gap behind a framed document, which reveals a hole behind it which contains a diary - Oboro's mother's diary. Oboro reveals more about her mother (extremely talented witch, low magical power) and that her only memory of her is eating with her mother, but is disappointed that their is no evidence of her in her mother's lab nor in her diary so assumes that she never mattered to her. Haruka is unconvinced that is the truth (she isn't around to have her mind probed) and instead believes that there is something left behind for Oboro - as shown by a space on the bookshelf that exists even after the reset. They place the diary in said space and the moonlight hits it, refracted through the gemstone on its spine to hit a framed gemstone, which refracts the light into the aquarium. THe aquarium lights up and the rises up and forms a spirit which replays a message left by Oboro's mother for her. The message (that will only play once) reveals that she can't return to Oboro, but Oboro is her precious daughter and she should believe in herself, also the omelette rice (the meal she had with Oboro) was tasty. Once Oboro has dried her eyes and recomposed herself, they all decide to head out of the room, only to find that the door is locked.

                    Oboro fires off a particularly strong spell to blow the door away, but it has no effect although, being in the room is weakening Oboro's resonance and thus her magic power. They haven't got long to get at out, as Walpurgis Night ends in 30 minutes and they would disappear with the room. Haruka tries to break open the window using a table, but it just bounces off, so suggests looking through Oboro's mother's belongings she left for her daughter as they may hold a clue. Oboro channels magical energy through her mother's diary, with Maruna also providing energy as well, which reveals that her mother locked the room on that night as a defence mechanism to protect others as she had fallen into power trance from too much resonation with the moon, as the moon's influence on the witches' world is at it strongest on Walpurgis Night and Oboro's mother resonated with the moon. She also left the following words of warning: "Do not lock eyes with the moon". As she is relaying these words of warning to the others, Maruna locks eyes with the moon, plunging her into a power trance and flinging Haruka and Oboro out of the room as a way of saving them. Believing that the preceding events were all part of her plan, Haruka gets angry at Oboro, who corrects him in that while she had a hunch that this was a possible outcome, she does not intend sacrifice Maruna. She fires off a spell at maximum resonance at the door to the room, while Haruka towards it, but seemingly does no damage although Haruka still re-enters into the room. Haruka tries everything he can to wake Maruna up, but nothing is working so is forced to use the nuclear option - kissing Maruna directly on the mouth. This works, but both are incredibly awkward and head for bed, which is a tad inconvenient for Oboro, because she wants know what is exactly so special about Haruka that allowed him to get back in to the room: is it the fact that is he is a guy or the fact that Maruna gave him some of his blood all those years ago. After all, Maruna and Oboro's mother are quite similar as her mother also had a partner to help her with her magic and also resonated with the moon like Maruna.<br/>
                    There are 2 bonus comics in this volume. The first one is about Haruka and Maruna trying to fall asleep after their kiss, while the other is about Miyu and Hikaru checking to see if they are still suffering from the effects of the love potion.
