                    This is my review of Volume 22 of Nisekoi and we are finishing Marika's final arc. This arc has been justifying Marika's actions towards Raku, which I understand but I have a hard sympathising with as she still made Raku's life difficult.

                    Marika’s mother, Chika, visits her daughter to see her before she is married and to tell her that she met Raku as well as that his unharmed and in the dungeon (with everyone else). Chika warns Marika threateningly that there would’t be a public outcry if something were to happen to him and if she doesn’t want something to happen to him or her friends, then she should cooperate. Chika leaves and is informed by a servant that they can’t contact the guards in dungeon, so on the assumption that some people are up to no good, Chika orders the wedding to moved an hour earlier (don't worry, the groom is already here). Honda visits Marika and compliments her on how she looks and Marika politely accepts before asking who else was captured alongside Raku. Honda cannot say, but (after some prodding by Marika) confirms that no one was injured. This puts Marika at ease, as she resigns to her fate. The ceremony begins and as the 'happy couple' are about to kiss, Raku dramatically enters to stop the wedding.

                    Whilst sneaking around through hidden passages within the walls of the house, Raku, Chitoge, Seishiro, Shu and Mikage all overhear that the ceremony has been moved up an hour and they now have 15 minutes to rescue Marika. Raku decides that they should head straight for the hall, even if they will be swarmed and overwhelmed by guards. The others are hesitant, but agree after seeing how persistent Raku is, and will hang back to slow any guards that might come after them. We return to where ended Chapter 189 and Chika demands, via an earpiece, that Marika tells him to leave. Marika informs Raku that there is no need to stop the wedding, as actually she always wanted this and is now truly happy. Raku agrees to relent, but doesn't agree that Marika is happy and while he doesn't love her, he considers her to be a close friend and he can't stand back if his friends need help. Marika is overjoyed at this confession and removes her earpiece and reverts her look to something she likes and not what her mother likes (symbolism!). She then asks Raku to whisk her away and then the others of the trespassing gang burst in to match the upcoming onslaught of guards. Seishiro criticises Raku for publicly rejecting a girl; not that he had much of choice (his opinion). Suddenly, most of the guards collapse as Kosaki's cooking kicks in, then Ruri and Kosaki make themselves known to the gang and explains why they are there. The gang steel themselves as they begin rescue Marika.

                    Almost everyone has exited the wedding venue and Honda asks that Marika does the same (by force if necessary). Marika decides not and instead will wait patiently for her knight in shining armour (Raku) to save her. Seishiro nominates herself to take on Honda and assures everyone that this time will be different, demonstrating by lifting a fastened pew and throwing it at some guards. She then orders Raku and Chitoge to get Marika and Kosaki and Ruri to get to safety before beginning to battle Honda. Raku and Chitoge charge towards Marika, moving each other into safety to avoid the guards' attacks, with Seishiro properly dealing with them. Honda tries psyche Seishiro out, by questioning her ability to participate in 2 battles at the same time as well as reminding the futility of the notion that they can truly save Marika. Seishiro assures of her awareness skills and counters the second point by deducing that Honda wishes to save Marika. Meanwhile, Marika's would-be-groom asks Marika for her ring, as it was his late wife's and that he is ok being leaving the altar unmarried as he only agreed to the marriage as a form of debt repayment towards Chika. He leaves and we never see him (nor his face) again. Raku and Chitoge come up against 3 ginormous guards, so Raku asks Chitoge to do 'it' and 'it' is to throw him, so she does and he knocks the 3 guards flying. Don't worry about Raku, having 2 tsunderes in his life really toughens you up, especially if you are harem series protagonist. Raku and Chitoge have now reached Marika.

                    As Kosaki and Ruri make their escape, there are chased by some guards, but Shu appears and boldly offers his services to which Ruri takes full advantage of and uses him to defend against the guards' attacks.<br/>
                    Chitoge and Raku have now reached Marika, but are unsure about the next steps until they hear Mikage, who appears from a hole in the ceiling and throws down a rope ladder from a helicopter (she is a lady with a lot of money and connections). The 3 start to climb the ladder (Marika hitches a ride on Raku), while Seishiro continues to pressure Honda to admit that she wishes to see Marika happy. Honda denies this, but the clear-headed Seishiro catches her combat chain and swings it down on to the ground, but Honda escapes and 'rescues' Marika from Raku's back, cutting the ladder in 2 (don't worry, Chitoge makes a perfect landing). Honda asks Marika why she is doing this, knowing she cannot escape her mother and Marika's response is that it makes her happy. One of Chika's entourage informs her that 'they' have arrived and 'they' is The Shadow Guard, an elite squad of operatives who are employed by the Tachibana's and count Honda as their leader. The Shadow guard assume their orders are to take out the intruders, but Chika corrects them and orders them to instead capture her daughter and they can be rough with her if need be (naughty children need to be disciplined). The Shadow Guard encircle Marika but before they can lay a finger on her, Honda jumps in and shields Marika.

                    Using her combat chain, Honda pushes The Shadow Guard back before swearing her support behind Marika, as that had been her intention all along. Honda apologises for the times she got in Marika's way and explains that seeing Marika grow and learn in order to be the perfect wife is what convinced her, while Marika is completely surprised by this revelation. Honda requests Seishiro's aid in holding The Shadow Guard, which she dutifully provides as they now on the same side. The 2 begin to fight The Shadow Guard and Mikage requests that they bust down a wall, which they immediately do. The large gaping hole provides a place where Mikage's helicopter can dangle the ladder to provide a clear exit for Marika. Seishiro catches on to Mikage's plan and asks Honda to help her clear the way for Marika, while Chika, frustrated at the current situation, shouts at The Shadow Guard, ordering them to stop Marika. The Shadow Guard fire their combat chains into the path of Marika (who has altered her outfit to allow for running), but Chitoge runs on ahead of Marika to give her a boost that allows her to clear the chains and stumbles into Raku's arms and whisked away by an ascending helicopter.

                    Chika is angry at herself as her daughter is stronger person than she is. Seishiro suggests now would be good time escape, Mikage has something to tell Chitoge that Raku doesn't know about. The Shadow Guard ask if the should chase after Marika, but Chika orders them not to. Chika's husband appears and comments how impossible it is to try an cage Marika and it is time that all the current female members of Tachibana family should be free: Marika and Chika. He comments that Chika sees too much of herself in her daughter as an explanation of her hard treatment of Marika and while Marika is abandoning her to be free and independent, he believes that Chika should also have that chance of freedom and he will help her if she needs it.<br/>
                    Meanwhile, Raku and Marika have been dropped off by the helicopter at the banks of nearby river and Raku takes this moment explains what he plans to do with Marika, based off what was discussed in Chapter 188. Marika is grateful for what he arranged, but cannot follow through and explains that she has been sick for along time and needs immediate treatment, which is only available from a hospital in Pittsburgh (USA) owned by the Tachibana family and thus will be back in her mother's clutches. Raku concludes that the entire rescue plan was futile, but Marika denies this as she now has a moment alone with Raku, where she can get to hear his true feelings and bring closure to her life of freedom which she will be able to fondly look back on with a sense of bitter melancholy. Chika calls to tell Marika that she free to do whatever she wants and there is no obligation to carry on the family legacy as it will end with her, Chika Tachibana. Marika is stunned by this revelation (what is it with Marika's mother figures surprising her today) and Raku promises that everyone will visit her whilst she is the hospital which sends Marika over the edge and she begins crying tears of joy.
