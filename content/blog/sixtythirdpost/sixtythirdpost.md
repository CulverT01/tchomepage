    This is my thirteenth update to my Alternative Formula E Points Format project. This is the final season I have had to back date for, so now all completed seasons have run under using the BTCC's points format. This is perfect timing as at 17:00 UTC on Saturday 6th December, the first race of Season 12 will begin in Sao Paulo and you can check where you can watch Formula E from <a href="https://www.fiaformulae.com/en/ways-to-watch">here</a>. Unlike with Season 11, I will update this site with an opinionated review of the ePrix (I am not promising objectivity) that focuses on how it would look using the alternative format and this will be uploaded on the usual day of Tuesday.<br/>
    As always, all files and documents are found in the GitHub repository: <a href="https://github.com/CulverT01/altfepointsformat">https://github.com/CulverT01/altfepointsformat</a> <br/>
    Please note that I have removed the username and password for the database from the admin program in the interest of security, but not from the viewer program as the user signed on there has read only permissions.

    <h3 class="row">Overall Drivers' Championship</h3>
    <p class="col-8"> 
    Jake Dennis wins the championship in real life with a total of 229 points and does the same under the alternative format with 218 points instead. He becomes the 4th driver under the alternative format to seal the championship before the final race, but the first to win it later than he would have in real life, as in real life, he wins the title with a race to spare but under the alternative format, Mitch Evan's win in the penultimate race means he is 23 points back and with the tiebreaker (Mitch has 4 wins to Jake's 2), needs a maximum score to take the title. However, Nick Cassidy beats him to pole position in the Qualifying final for Round 16, denying him a point he needed. 2nd place in real life goes to Nick Cassidy with a points total of 199 but under the alternative format, he finishes 3rd with 195 points as Mitch Evans would finish 2nd under the alternative format with a points total of 196 compared to a real life finish of 3rd and a points total of 197.<br/>
    3 drivers score less points and 2 drivers tie the points total across the 2 points formats. The 3 who score less are Jake Dennis, Mitch Evans, and Nick Cassidy who score 11, 1 ,and 4 less points respectively. The 2 who tie are Kelvin van der Linde and David Beckmann and they never finish higher than 16th, so score 0 points. The driver who gains the most points compared to their real life total is Stoffel Vandoorne, who scores 108 points which is a difference of 52, compared to his real life total of 56. The driver who gained the most positions compared to their final standings under the current format is Dan Ticktum, who moves up 3 places under the alternative format to finish 14th, with a points difference of 44 (2nd most of the grid), so scores 72 points under the alternative format compered to 28 in real life. The 2 drivers who lose the most positions compared to where they finished under Formula E's current format are Sam Bird and Rene Rast, who drops 2 places to finish 11th and 15th respectively, with points scores of 101 and 64 respectively under the alternative format compared to points totals of 95 and 64 respectively in real life. <br/>
    Normally I'd mention drivers who had notable performances across the season (both good and bad), but instead I wish to mention 1 performance by 1 driver and team during 1 race: Sebastien Buemi and Envision Racing at race 1 of the London ePrix. At this point Sebastien Buemi has been eliminated from title contention and is in Envision's interests that he helps out his teammate, Nick Cassidy, outscore Jake Dennis and he starts of doing so, but when he ends up ahead of Nick after Nick takes his 2nd attack mode, the team are don't tell him to not fight Nick and his aggressive defending ends up knocking his teammates's front wing loose which causes irreparable damage and Nick eventually retires - but there's more! Towards the end of the race, we get a late race safety car which turns into a red flag after Sacha Fenestraz suffers a brake issue and fails to stop for turn 16, necessitating barrier repairs. This means there will not be enough time left for Sebastien to use all of his remaining Attack mode as once he can take, there will be about 4 minutes of racing left  - he has 6 minutes of Attack mode to take. While he isn't the only one with outstanding Attack mode, everyone else has far less (Andre Lotterer has the most at 4 minutes). While the rules don't explicitly state the penalty for finishing with Attack mode remaining, past precedent suggests a post-race drive-through penalty converted to a time penalty would be a punishment (see race 2 of 2021 Diriyah ePrix in Season 7) and for the London EXCEL Circuit, the time would be 20 seconds. However, in order to finish both his Attack mode and the ePrix without a penalty, Sebastien must drive about 39 seconds off the pace (the pace being about 1:14-1:15) or the equivalent of about 2 drive-throughs per lap (for further comparison, the 2nd highest sporting penalty the stewards can award is a 10 second stop-and-go, which is about 35 seconds at the EXCEL Circuit).<br/>
    This drastic offset of pace puts him at risk involved in an incident, which happens at the end of lap 34 (first lap he has to drive slowly) as he and Norman Nato collide in turn 19, blocking the track. Norman is the only one penalised for this incident and has 5 seconds added to his race time and Sebastien and Envision's bone-headed, brain-dead stupidity is rewarded as the red flag called for for this incident allows his Attack mode to run out and now he has more usable energy and can be more aggressive on the subsequent restart. That said, he doesn't run at the necessary pace to avoid an penalty, as instead he is about 2 seconds off the pace per sector, so would have picked up a penalty anyway unless the intent was to cause an incident that would nullify the race either via safety car or via race stoppage that would slow the pace down so their Attack mode is finished before the race is and they get to keep their current track position (4th on the road, later 3rd thanks to Antonio Felix da Costa's 3 minute penalty for a tyre being under pressure which is a separate issue I will not go into here).<br/>
    If I was in Tommaso Volpe's shoes (boss of Nissan Formula E Team) I would have stormed over to Envision's garage and demanded answers for their race-ruining stupidity and argued that Sebastien's pace was enough evidence to prove that Norman was not majorly responsible for the collision. I was at this race and with the exception of day afterwards (although that race was hampered by torrential rain that we were lucky to get a race in anyway) I have yet to attend another Formula E event and won't until they stop racing at the EXCEL and find a support series to join them as well. In my opinion, Gen 4 will kill any enthusiasm a fan could have for that track because the racing will be even worse.<br/>

    <h3 class="row">Customer Trophy for Drivers</h3>
    <p class="col-8">
    The championship is won by Jake Dennis who becomes the first driver to win both the Customer Trophy for Drivers and the Overall Drivers' Championship and does so with a points total of 255. 2nd place goes to Nick Cassidy with 248 points and probably could have won it had his teammate Sebastien Buemi not taken him out in London. The 2 win the class a combined 15 times, with Nick having the slight majority of 8 wins Jake's 7 (the other race is won by Sebastien Buemi). Robin Frijns is largely irrelevant this season as his finishing streak is broken (like his wrist) after being caught up in a lap 1 incident in the first race of the season and misses the next 4 races (would have been 3 as ABT CUPRA Formula E Team would withdraw from the Cape Town ePrix), so is the only non-deputising driver to score double digit points.<br/>

    <h3 class="row">Nelson Piquet Jr Trophy</h3>
    <p class="col-8">
    The winner of the Trophy is Dan Ticktum who scores 242 points over Sacha Fenestraz, who scores on 213 points to finish 2nd. This year, no driver wins the class 4 times and doesn't win the title, instead they win it 5 times and finish 3rd which is what happened for Jake Hughes. Dan ties Oliver Askew for most most class wins overall at 10. Dan wins the title with a race to spare (the first time since season 3 that this has happened), mostly because all his title rivals hit issues in the preceding races. Jake Hughes crashes during qualifying for race 1 of the Rome ePrix and the damage is too great for him to start the ePrix, Sergio Sette Camara suffers a battery voltage issue in the 2nd Rome race, and Sacha's documented brake issue and subsequent retirement takes him out in London's race 1. Technically, one could include Roberto Mehri in this as well as he retires from the Portland ePrix due to a technical failure, but he is eliminated from title contention after his first start as when he joins in Jakarta, there 140 points left available and then championship leader Sergio Sette Camara had scored 140 points.<br/>

    <h3 class="row">Overall Teams' Championship</h3>
    <p class="col-8">
    Envision Racing win the teams title in real life and under the alternative format with a points totals of 304 and 311 respectively becoming the 2nd ever customer team to win the Overall Teams' Championship as Techeetah would do so in Season 4 (although not in real life, so Envision are the 1st in real life). 2nd place in real life is Jaguar TCS Racing, who finish with a points score of 292, but do not finish there under the alternative format as TAG Heuer Porsche Formula E Team instead finish 2nd with a points total of 281. Jaguar finish 3rd under the alternative format with 280 points, while Porsche finishes 4th in real life with 242 points. Only Jaguar scores more points in real life than under the alternative format and the only changes in the standings between the 2 formats is Porsche finishing ahead of both Jaguar and Andretti under the alternative format instead of behind them. The seemingly dramatic drop-off in performance that will haunt NEOM McLaren Formula E Team next season is also present here as, despite Jake Hughes having one of the best opening 3 races for a Formula E career, the team slip from what seems like at worst a comfortable 6th place in the standings mid-season to a lonely 8th by the end of it. If Envision had accepted the incoming drive-through penalty and have Sebastien Buemi finish about 14th, then it would have not affected their position in the standings under the alternative format, as they would have finished with 298 points and Porsche with 282, assuming: Sergio Sette Camara is still disqualified, Antonio Felix da Costa still picks up a 3 minute penalty, and Sebastien doesn't collide with Norman Nato so the latter doesn't pick up a penalty. However, in real life, they would lose the teams' title as the points gap between Envision and Jaguar is 12 points and that is less than 15 points the points they scored from the first London race.<br/>

    <h3 class="row">Customer Teams' Championship </h3>
    <p class="col-8">
    Envision Racing claim their 3rd ever Customer Teams' Championship, with a points total of 291 and becomes the first customer team to win both the overall and Customer Teams' Championship in the same season. 2nd place goes to Avalanche Andretti Formula E, who finish with a points total of 281. Envision and Andretti are the only customer teams to win the class, meaning ABT CUPRA Formula E Team are the only customer team never to win the class (Team Aguri claim 1 class win in Season 2 and HWA Racelab win the class thrice in Season 5) as they fail to win the class in Season 10 as well. While it's not shown in the points standings, NEOM McLaren Formula E Team come dangerously close to finishing 4th in class as their poor performance in the latter half of the season sees them be only 2 points off ABT and are saved by having both ABT cars retire from the first London race.<br/>

    <h3 class="row">Manufacturers' Cup</h3>
    <p class="col-8">
    Stellantis wins their first Manufacturers' Cup with points total of 422 over Porsche, who finishes with 361 points as well as sealing with a round to spare. They don't win the Manufacturers' Cup if it had been run in Season 9, as that goes to Jaguar instead who would have scored 491 compared to under the alternative format where they finish 3rd with 352 points. The reason for the difference are effectively the same for Renault and Mercedes-Benz's titles in Season 3 and 8 respectively - numbers of entrants. Compared to everyone else, Stellantis have 4 cars that are eligible to score points for the Manufacturers' Cup (the cars from DS Penske and Maserati MSG Racing) meaning it is harder for them to have a bad result. This is done because when the Manufacturers' Cup was thought up during Season 10, Stellantis was chosen to represent DS Automobiles and Maserati, as it is the parent company of both brands and the Maserati powertrain in a rebadged DS powertrain, so thus Stellantis is considered a registered Manufacturer and not DS nor Maserati. This doesn't impact real life as customer teams score manufacturer points as well, so Maserati/Penske effectively counts as a customer team. Only Porsche and Jaguar score less points under the alternative format than in hypothetical real life and only Nissan and Porsche maintain the same position across the standings as: Stellantis swaps with Jaguar to finish 3rd in real life and Mahindra and NIO swap places, so NIO finishes ahead of Mahindra under the alternative format. In hypothetical real life, Porsche dominate the standings and lead the standings for an impressive 13 races, although not consecutive as Jaguar lead after Monaco, only to have a poor race 1 at Jakarta and immediately lose that lead. However, as Porsche's results start to tail off (excluding Jake Dennis, who is probably the sole reason they lead for so long post-Jakarta), Jaguar's improve enough for them to take the lead after the first London race and win the Cup. As powertrains are one of the few parts a manufacturer can have complete control over in Formula E, it make some sense to use the Manufacturers' Cup standings as a way to measure performance and I think that both formats can do this, but only when the competitors have the same amount of chances to score points cin the championship on any given weekend. Thus the alternative format works better for seasons 2-8, as for those seasons pretty much everyone builds their own powertrain and thus will have 2 entrants for the Manufacturers' Cup, while the current format works better for season 9 onwards as more teams have someone else build their powertrain and so those who supply another team don't have the massive advantage that Renault had in seasons 3 and 4 as well as Mercedes-Benz in season 8.<br/>
