                    This is my review of the Nisekoi Volume 2. The chapters now are lot shorter and so the summaries will be smaller, as one of my personal criticisms with the last review was about how long some of those summaries ended up being.

                    The plot of the chapter is about a group study session at Raku's home, that is organised by Ruri Miyamoto (Onodera's friend who appeared in Volume 1, but hasn't been named until now). She has done this so Onodera has a chance to get close to the boy she loves: Raku Ichijo. However, Onodera isn't willing to flirt with a man that is spoken for, so she is tense around him and avoids his gaze. Ruri tries to get Raku to help Onodera with her homework, but Chitoge intercepts and helps instead, which annoys Raku but pleases her. Chitoge asks Onodera if she likes anyone, which she denies, and Chitoge responds with a similar response before backtracking because she has someone - Raku. Shu begins to tease the couple, but before he can do any damage, Raku pulls him away to set the record straight about him and Chitoge. Shu reveals he worked out about their fake relationship from the start and was just messing with him. He then asks if Raku's going to confess his feelings to Onodera, after all she has a crush on him. <br /> 
                    The Shuei-Gumi members continue to be the best source of comedy in this series with their welcome sign for Raku and his friends being the comedic highlight of the chapter.

                    The chapter continues on from the previous one with Raku and Shu arguing over whether or not Onodera has a crush on Raku, with the result being probably not. They return to the group before Shuei-Gumi members try to help further Raku's relationship with Chitoge by locking both of them in a storeroom. This mildly inconveniences Raku but Chitoge is petrified, so he promises not leave her side, despite her tsundere protestations. In order to past the time he suggests talking and the first topic is Onodera. Raku praises Onodera a bit too much, but Chitoge is too dense to realise that he could be in love with her. The next topic is kissing, which inevitably leads to an argument in which Chitoge realises that she's no longer scared and attempts to get up only to fall on top of Raku. Luckily, they are saved by Claude opening the storeroom door, but leads to an awkward situation that sees Onodera run away, embarrassed at what they could've been doing, and Claude, mad at what they could've been doing. <br /> 
                    At the end of the volume, there is a bonus comic that details an interaction between Ruri and Shu. Ruri asks Shu about Chitoge and Raku's relationships, as she has doubts about it, but he brushes them off by teasing her, leading her to think that he is better off dead.

                    The chapter begins with Raku seeking out Onodera to clear up last chapter's misunderstanding, only for him to overhear a conversation between she and Ruri where he finds out that Onodera made a promise to a boy 10 years ago and has a key. Surely, she can't be the girl who he made that promise 10 years ago that is far too convenient, besides that kind of thing was in fashion 10 years ago, so it could be anyone. Ruri's next scheme to get Raku and Onodera together involves some swim training for a practice meet the next day and Onodera is competing, but doesn't know how to swim, so Raku and Chitoge will teach her because a: he's her crush and b: she's really athletic. (Shu is also here being a perverted nuisance, so Ruri drags him away after every interaction he has). Chitoge is far too advanced a swimmer to be an effective teacher, so Raku alone must do it, but Onodera is too cute for him to handle, thus progress is slow. Onodera leaves to get some drinks and in absence of everyone else, Raku goes over to her stuff to see if the key she carried in fits inside his pendant.

                    Raku tries the key, only to find it doesn’t fit and on closer inspection it doesn’t look like the that she dropped back in volume 1. Then the girls return and inform him that he has the key to the girls changing room and proceed with necessary action by tying him up. Raku pleads his innocence, with only Onodera partially believing in him, but that is enough to convince the others to think the same. Ruri thanks Chitoge for allowing them to borrow her boyfriend, which triggers a delayed reaction from her, further fuelling Ruri’s suspicions about them. The practice meet begins and Raku and Chitoge bickering continue which culminate in him reminding her to stretch and she ignoring such advice. This ends up on backfiring on her she gets cramp in both her legs and begins to drown. Raku immediately jumps in to rescue her and brings her poolside before being informed that she isn’t breathing and mouth-to-mouth resuscitation is needed. As he moves in, Chitoge wakes up and responds how you’d expect - violently. Afterwards, Ruri tells Onodera to forget the boy she met 10 years ago and focus on her current love life, as the only thing she can remember about the boy is that he had a lock-shaped pendant which as we all know, were all the rage 10 years ago. Meanwhile Shu has got himself and Raku in trouble with Chitoge by calling her fat.

                   The chapter begins at lunch the next day with Chitoge moaning about Rakus's conduct during the swim meet. Onodera tells her that Raku actually saved her and immediately regrets her actions and resolves to apologise. Attempt 1 results in Raku assuming it is about the comments that Shu made the day previous and he criticizes her diet, which annoys her. Attempt 2 is based around getting Raku a gift, but Chitoge's aggressive nature causes it to fail. Attempt 3 is again devolves around a misunderstanding this time around the mouth-to-mouth incident and that makes her mad. Chitoge retreats to Ruri and Onodera and complains about Raku, to which Ruri questions their relationship and that prompts Chitoge to confide the truth about their relationship before leaving. Now knowing the truth about Raku and Chitoge's relationship, Onodera resolves to confess her feelings.

                    The chapter moves to focus on Raku, as he heads to care for the animals, noting that the chain on his pendant is damaged and will need replacing soon. He meets up with Chitoge and asks if she was trying to thank him. She responds dismissively before asking why he saved her and that offends him so he insults her back, expecting a comeback (as that is their relationship already), but instead gets a sincere apology (in English), but still gets the gist despite not understanding what she said. Chitoge leaves and on her way out finds Raku's pendant with a broken chain. <br />
                    Ruri asks Onodera why she likes Raku, which she struggles to put into words. Raku appears and Ruri decides to leave so Onodera will confess her feelings. Both Onodera and Raku are super nervous, especially Onodera, as she shows fever-like temperatures and that panics Raku, further exemplifying why she loves him. She begins to confess her feelings, whilst Chitoge looks at Raku's pendant remembering that she made promise to a boy when she was younger and made the promise by saying "Zwazse in Love"- could she be Raku's promise girl?

                    The confession is interrupted by a stray baseball that absolutely shatters the window Raku and Onodera were standing next to - both are unharmed. Raku is almost convinced that she was going to confess, but instead believes he had a nose hair sticking out. Onodera on the other hand, is disappointed that she couldn't confess her feelings. Ruri chastises Onodera afterwards but still praises her for doing her best. <br /> 
                    Chitoge is still thinking about the promise that she made all those years ago and how similar it is to Raku's, but they can't one and the same. The next day she arrives at Raku's to hand the pendant over that she has had fixed, but doesn't tell that she did. The chapter ends with Claude handing a shadowy figure a photo of Raku telling them that he is their next target. <br />
                    I'll mention now that Ruri is the best named character, thanks to the combination of her loyalty, her no-nonsense personality and her deadpan reactions on her face.

                    The chapter opens up with the introduction of a new character, Seishiro Tsugumi, who transfers into the class. Tsugumi is well known to Chitoge and immediately showers her with affection. Tsugumi's antics towards Chitoge are enough to start convincing the class that Raku's isn't the best for Chitoge, ignoring the personal reasons that they may have as to why they're together. During lunch, Tsugumi invites Raku up onto the school roof to ask about his relationship with Chitoge and how committed he is to her. During this exchange, Tsugumi launches at Raku, placing a gun under his chin and bemoans his inability to stop the attack. Tsugumi lets Raku go, confident that, in time, Chitoge will leave Raku because she has someone far more superior available. Raku realises the chaos such future would bring and reminds Tsugumi whose girlfriend she is. <br />
                    The illustration at the end of the chapter shows Chitoge asking Shu where Raku and Tsugumi are as well as why he is wet, as he had been soaked by Raku spraying some juice, he'd been drinking in reaction to something Tsugumi had said.

                    The final chapter of the volume continues where the last one finished, with Chitoge interrupting Raku and Tsugumi's conversation and she attempts to defuse the situation, only for Tsugumi to ignore her attempts and instead challenge Raku to duel that'll commence that afternoon. After Tsugumi leaves, Chitoge explains what mess he has got himself into by explaining Tsugumi's backstory and probable reason for being here. She also blames him for provoking Tsugumi even though there is little he could've done, seeing as the main issue Tsugumi has with Raku is his relationship with Chitoge and that was decided by their fathers. She still wants Raku to win, not because she cares for him but because of the chaos that'll ensue if he loses. <br />
                    The duel begins with everyone betting that Tsugumi will win and Raku immediately running away as Tsugumi fires at him with as many guns as one can have in a single hand. Fortunately for Raku, this makes Tsugumi a terrible shot, which is surprising given that Tsugumi is one of Beehive's best assassins. Tsugumi calls out Raku on his apparent cowardice and how that will never help him in protecting Chitoge to which Raku snaps back that Chitoge is tougher than Tsugumi think she is and a real man would know this and give her some space, which infuriates Tsugumi. Realising he can't run forever; Raku decides to jump out of a window and Tsugumi follows suit. The window in question was above the school pool and Raku has Minecraft physics turned on, so he'll take no fall damage whereas Tsugumi will. Raku drags himself and Tsugumi out of the pool and begins undress both of them only to find out that Tsugumi is a girl. <br />
                    There are some bonus comics at the end of the volume and they all relate to Chitoge, Raku and Onodera's time at Junior High School particularly around Valentine’s Day, with the Onodera one being the funniest.
