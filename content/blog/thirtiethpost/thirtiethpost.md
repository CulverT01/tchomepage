                    This is my review of Nisekoi Volume 11. This volume is finishing the amnesia storyline from the end of the last volume and also focusses on Marika; another of my least favourite characters. My opinion of Shu changed from he is unbearable, to he is alright if he is not being a perverted jokester, such as: his act he puts on in front of the class. Maybe my opinion of Marika will also change.

                    Marika has found an old picture book, which triggers the same memory that his pendant does from last chapter - the one about a little girl. They begin to read the book, to trigger more memories for Raku, which is about a prince and a princess who are separated because of a war between their kingdoms. The prince goes out to find the princess, only to encounter obstacles in the way but is aided by some girls with keys. The ending has been ripped out of the book, with Raku offering the explanation, that the ending is a sad one and he once rewrote the ending to this story for a girl who was reading it about 10 years ago. They all decide to head home, with Chitoge determined to find a copy of that book that she has at her home, however Raku reveals another key detail about the girl he remembers: she didn't have blue eyes, which does Chitoge have, so she couldn't possibly the girl from his memories.

                     Chitoge is heartbroken over the fact she isn't the girl from Raku's memory and hides her disappointment with an attitude. Their search brings up nothing, so she asks him what he'll do if he finds his promise girl and he says nothing, as he has Chitoge now. This does nothing to ease Chitoge fears as only things that could jog his memory were the things associated with his promise girl. Raku tries to comfort her, but this causes her to emotionally dump onto Raku the truth about their relationship and how they feel about each other. Nothing seems to be working, but then Raku spots the stuffed gorilla toy he got Chitoge for her last birthday and says 'gorilla', which triggers Chitoge into to punch him and this cures his amnesia, but he remembers nothing whilst he was an amnesiac.

                    It is time for Chitoge's birthday, and everyone is brought up to speed with the events of the chapter and Raku finally apologies for initially forgetting about Chitoge's birthday. Claude once again tries to outdo Raku, but misses the mark by getting Chitoge she can't really use and Raku gets her a bouquet of Sweet Pea flowers, based on a hunch he had (Chitoge had expressed a liking to these flowers whilst he was amnesiac). Later on, Chitoge finds her dad looking over an old photo album and spots herself in them with brown eyes - the same as Raku's promise girl (she's back in the game!). Caucasians (which Chitoge is) can have their eye colour change when growing up if you're wondering as to why. Meanwhile, Raku is going through the picture book that Kosaki had in a hope of remembering any more details, but can't although, he does note the similarities between the story and his current situation regarding the pendant and the keys to supposedly unlock it.

                    The chapter begins with Kosaki taste-testing a possible future sweet for her family's shop. Afterwards, Haru teases her about her getting fat, which Kosaki brushes off, but is still concerned that she at least weighs herself and the results aren't good. She decides to check with Ruri to see if she thinks she is putting on a few pounds, who doesn't really confirm or deny that, but still recommends to be careful with what you eat, which Kosaki translates as that you are becoming rotund. Kosaki decides to forgo treats for time being as well as eating less food, as she had skipped breakfast that morning. This tactic backfires on her, when her stomach grumbles and exposes her dieting attempt in front of Raku, who cannot know under any circumstances that she is pudgy. She disguises her stomach rumbles as earthquake rumbles and tries to placate her stomach by eating her lunch early, only for Raku to catch her, but there is hope in form of P.E that ends with her nearly drowning in the pool. Her efforts go unrewarded, as when she weighs herself that night, her weight has gone up significantly. The next day, Raku offers Kosaki her favourite food, candied sweet potatoes, to which she runs away from, only for him to chase her down to ask if there's anything wrong and she should eat something as she is so thin she could waste away. Also, the scale at her house was broken and no one had told her or done anything about it such as disposing of it.

                    The chapter begins with Raku asking Kosaki when her birthday is and finds out that is tomorrow. He enlists the help of Haru, as Ruri would just end up volunteering Kosaki in her stead, with the promise that he'll buy all the snacks on the trip to a shopping centre that is hosting a Japanese dessert festival. Haru initially doesn't want to be there and phones in her help, but the 2 bond over similar tastes in Japanese desserts, which frustrates Haru especially after one of the vendors mistook them for being on a date. She then describes the closest she experience she has had to a date which was last year where someone in a bear costume (Raku) helped find her sister after getting lost at a school festival. Haru decides to move on and tries on an outfit to get for Kosaki, as with her down she looks like her sister, which is her excuse as to why she was flattered by Raku's comments when he spots her in the outfit. Raku shows her a brooch that he plans on giving Kosaki and she tells him that her being there was pointless, as they have similar tastes and then walks off. Haru then gets lost in the shopping centre before Raku finds her and grabs her hand, which reminds her of the person in the bear costume.

                    At the school entrance, Raku meets a girl who asks where the staff room is and before he can answer Marika appears and identifies the girl as an old friend called Mikage. Mikage is visiting the local area, so is attending their school for the day, mostly as a way to check up on Marika as she was initially bullied at her old junior high school. Mikage appears to be a nice and polite girl, but is actually a raging creep and a pervert, as demonstrated by her sniffing Chitoge's hair after meeting her. Mikage asks Marika about her 'Ultra studly' fiancé, so Marika quickly distracts her to explain the situation to Raku - they going to have to pretend to be lovers for the day. Raku agrees after Marika cashes in her favour from Valentine's Day, so Marika begins to introduce her fiancé to Mikage, whose initially responses are naturally pervy, but after she finds out they have yet to kiss, declares that she isn't going home until they do.

                    Marika and Raku decide to explain the current situation Chitoge and the others, in a fanciful hope that they'd understand. However, they spot Mikage trying to get the lowdown on their 'relationship' from some of their classmates and drag her away to explain that they have secretive relationship that no one else really knows about. However, Mikage still spills the beans to Chitoge later, which the entire class overhears and the explanation does nothing to ease the situation. Wishing to lie low, Raku decides to skip the rest of school, so Mikage hands him and Marika tickets to nearby amusement park, to which she'll tag along in disguise. Raku, ever the gentleman, begins to take the lead with the date, but this flusters Marika, so heads off to get her a drink, whilst Mikage reveals herself to Marika and asks if she has told Raku about a 'you-know-what'.

                    Raku returns to overhear the 'you-know-what', but decides not to follow it up with Marika. Mikage admits defeat and allows the couple to enjoy the rest of date without the pressure of needing to kiss. This lasts until they get to a Ferris wheel, where Mikage gets the 2 alone in a Ferris wheel compartment, with expectation that they'll kiss - the traitor. Raku and Marika sit in awkward silence, until Marika thanks Raku for going along with the 'boyfriend', in a moment of rare sincerity and humility. She then asks if he wants to kiss, which Raku interprets as teasing, but is assured that the request is serious, until she pulls out at the last second to remark how red with embarrassment he is - this is what I hate about her, the constant teasing and almost lack of genuine sincerity really removes any possible positive aspects her character could have.<br/> 
                    They say goodbye to Mikage, who reveals that she was one of people who bullied Marika back in junior high and that she knew that the 2 were faking their relationship - so how does Chitoge and Raku manage to fool everyone (except Chitoge's mother)? Answers on a postcard. As they part ways, Marika distracts Raku to kiss him on the cheek.

                    The chapter takes place during Raku and Kosaki's final year at junior high school. Their main interaction is saying 'Good Morning' and 'See you later' and in an effort to keep this up, Kosaki decides to apply to the same high school as Raku - Bonyari High School. While Bonyari isn't an elite school, Kosaki grades currently aren't enough for her to pass the exam, so she studies really hard in an effort to get in. However, it still isn't enough and she fails to make the cut, so has to go to her backup school: Otori Girls' High School. Devastated that she'll never be able to greet Raku again, she sits on a bench whilst it snows (too cold to rain), only for Raku to appear and try to comfort her, using his very long scarf that he knitted. The awkward tension is broken when Kosaki's mother calls to let her know that she has got in via the wait list and everyone celebrates.<br/> 
                    The bonus comic for this volume continues following the adventures of Magical Confectioner Kosaki, where we are introduced to a new magical girl: Magical Gorilla Chitoge, who is upset at how un-cute her magical costume is.
