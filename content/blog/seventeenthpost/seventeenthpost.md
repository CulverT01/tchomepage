                    Welcome to my review of Nisekoi Volume 4. Personally, if you're reading this series, then you're reading it for the romance and interactions between the main leads rather than the comedy but if you can find comedy within these interactions then more power to you.

                    The chapter begins with Tsugumi finding a love letter in her shoe locker from Toru Suzuya - an intelligent, attractive and athletic member of the school's football (soccer) team. Unfortunately for Toru, Tsugumi doesn't know what a love letter is, but Ruri is only too happy to part with such information, which flusters Tsugumi a lot. Onodera assumes that Tsugumi is going to reject Toru, as Tsugumi loves someone else, to which she vehemently denies. She asks what she should do and is told to think about it and respond based on what she wants, so she thinks about it and does so on the roof during lunch. Her solitude is broken when Raku comes up to the roof to eat his lunch because his girlfriend is eating lunch with her girl-friends. Tsugumi wants to be alone and asks him leave curtly, but still asks him about 'type of guy' means and Raku explains, so she then asks him what his type of girl is, because she wants an example - it's not like she likes him or anything! Raku initially describing Onodera, before realising his 'type' is Chitoge, and instead describes her, but description ends up being closer to Tsugumi. Tsugumi asks about 'going out' and Raku explains that Toru wants to be Tsugumi's boyfriend, but she can't accept that, as she has to protect Chitoge, and asks why anyone would fall in love with her. Raku tells to get over it, people fall in love all the time and the decent thing is to give him answer in person. Tsugumi finally asks Raku how he'd feel if he got a love letter from her and responds that it would be great to receive such a letter from her, so she explodes right in front of him (metaphorically). After school that day, Tsugumi meets with Toru and rejects him before meeting with everyone as they were listening in. She thanks Raku for what he said, which confuses him, before shooting Shu as he attempts to reveal her crush to Raku.

                   Tsugumi calls Ruri, Onodera and Raku over to discuss Chitoge's birthday that is today and Tsugumi wishes for them to come over to celebrate. Ruri takes this as a chance to set Onodera and Raku on date to buy Chitoge’s present after school. They meet in a cafe, where before entering Onodera smartens herself up before entering by using the window the shop, not noticing that Raku is inside on the other side of the window and can see everything. They then go out shopping, which over so quickly there's no panel of them actually shopping (the best we get is a back illustration showing the present in the next chapter), so Onodera invites Raku on a detour to secret spot, that only she knows of, which gives one a great view of their home town. Onodera sharing this secret is her way of thanking Raku and stoked by the honour of sharing a secret with Onodera, he promises not divulge the secret. He then decides to ask her about her birthday, but the words that come out instead ask if she was his promise girl to which she responds with yes. Roll credits: the series is over folks; the mystery has been solved.

                    The chapter continues from the revelation of the last chapter, with Onodera back-pedalling a bit as she cannot confirm that she is his promise girl as she can't remember what the boy looked like, but he had a pendant like Raku and that came with a key that she has. Also, the likelihood that he isn't the boy she met is so low, that may as well be impossible, besides no one else has a key like hers anyway. The tension is broken when Tsugumi calls Raku to berate him for not being Chitoge's house already, so they leave for the party - the pendant can wait until tomorrow. They all meet up, including Shu who is there for some reason, at Chitoge's house, surprising her as well as making her nervous because, her family's business has been a turn off for many a prospective friend. Raku immediately rips this plaster of a situation off, by telling everyone the truth and they okay with as they know how to deal with this as they're friends with Raku. Everyone moves inside and begins handing out presents, with Claude trying to make it a competition with Raku, only to predictably lose. <br /> 
                    Later, both Raku and Chitoge go outside to get some air and Chitoge immediately begins to criticise Raku's present, so he tells her get rid of it if she doesn't like it only for her to say that she'll take care of it , because that is what good girlfriends do - it's not like she likes it or anything, <i>idiot!</i> She then asks him if he still in love with the girl he 10 years ago and he assumes that it is still Onodera, so he confirms that and she responds by asking if 'Zawsze in Love' mean anything - the words that the promise of 10 years ago were made under

                    The chapter follows on from the cliffhanger of the last chapter with Chitoge explaining how she knows the words 'Zawsze in Love' as well as how she came to be in possession of a key. They both realise that they may have made that promise, but that can't be as the girl Raku met and the boy that Chitoge met are nothing like each other are now and we all know people's personalities don't change between age 5 and 15. Regardless, they still decide to try Chitoge's key in Raku's Pendant and in the process, Chitoge's key snaps inside the lock, meaning it can't be opened. <br />
                    They both leave, separately, to return to the party and on the way back Raku meets Chitoge's Dad, Adelt, and he asks Raku how he and Chitoge are getting on, whilst accepting the situation they're in doesn't help much. Raku gives a middling answer, which Adelt takes as him being modest and mentions how compatible they are given that they met 10 years ago. As Raku begins to deal with this information, Adelt drops another bombshell when he reveals that Onodera was also there, meaning that Onodera or Chitoge is Raku's promise girl.

                    Raku's pendant has been placed in the care of Shu's Uncle, who is going to fix it, although it’s going to take some time. Chitoge appears to be calm and collected after the events of last night, but acts awkward around Raku. Onodera meets up with Raku to test her key only to find out that it's broken, so we won't find out if she is Raku's promise girl for a while. <br />
                    The gang's teacher informs their whole class that the photos taken during the school trip are available to order and are shown on a large bulletin board. Chitoge's awkwardness is cured by this opportunity and rushes around ordering as many photos, while Ruri points out a photo with, she and Onodera in it - in the background of a shot of Raku. Chitoge finds a photo of Raku and Onodera holding hands and they both want it but are afraid of anyone finding out, so awkwardly dismiss it. Shu calls Raku over to have a look at his embarrassing photos of girls (dirty photos go against his morals apparently) to which he rightly faces karma for, but not before giving Raku a photo of Onodera sleeping. As Raku leaves, he notices a photo that has Onodera changing and takes to give it to his teacher, so no one can have a copy of the photo. Unfortunately, as he leaves, he bumps into Onodera and drops the photo, who picks it up before he can snatch it away. All Onodera sees of the photo is Chitoge, who is in the foreground, further fuelling the belief that Raku might actually be in love Chitoge. <br />
                    The back illustrations for this chapter are the embarrassing photos Shu handed to Ruri and Onodera.

                    The chapter begins with Raku returning home from school, pondering who the girl he made the promise with. He believes there might be some photos from that time that could help, so he asks his dad who tells him that there’s a photo taken 10 years ago with him and young girl with a key and the reason why is because of some promise he made with her. Raku begins fervently searching, only to turn up nothing. <br />
                    During the next day at school, Shu invites Raku to a study session after school at a fast-food restaurant. Raku initially declines, but changes his mind when he finds out Onodera is going. The study session is with the whole gang and when they begin to sit down to start studying, Onodera declines Ruri offers to sit next Raku, which concerns her, and she begins to act distant towards him as well. Shu quizzes Tsugumi about her academic ability, to which she admits nonchalantly that she's quite smart and proves by helping Raku with a problem. Raku then praises her on her teaching ability which makes her blush. Shu decides the move the focus onto some English homework based around a story where a man is cornered by his female lover about being with another woman, with Chitoge narrating it as she speaks English. During the reading, Raku mind wanders to who is promise girl is and zones out of the conversations being said and nearly reveals his true feelings about Onodera. <br />
                    Raku returns home to continue his search for that key photo, armed with a drawing the box it's stored in. He finds the photo and the girl featured on it is <b>NOT</b> Onodera <b>NOR</b> Chitoge, but someone completely different. Another Twist!

                    Raku calls for his dad to identify the girl in the photo he found last chapter, only for his dad to have left and unable to answer his question, so agonises about all of the next day. It starts to rain during the day meaning, if you're walking from home, you going to need an umbrella unless you're Chitoge, then you chance it anyway. Raku prevents her from doing so and shares his umbrella. Chitoge notices that Raku is getting more wet than her, so she cosies up to him, so he has more space under the umbrella. This weirds him out, so he starts staring at her and she takes it as him leering at her, which naturally then leads to arguing and name calling. The war of the words is interrupted by a lightning strike, which frightens Chitoge, so they take refuge under a gazebo in a nearby park. To alleviate Chitoge's fears, they begin talking and use their chosen photos of school trip as a starting point. Raku remarks at the progress Chitoge has made socially, which Chitoge agrees to, whilst remarking that dating Raku ruins it, but it is getting better recently - <i>NOT! </i>Karma catches up with Chitoge real fast as lightning strikes causing to cling to Raku, as Raku' dad passes by to tell Raku that his fiancé coming to see him.

                    Raku's dad informs Raku and Chitoge about the whole fiancé situation and why it is not easy to back out and the girl in the photo he found. I think right now the true villain of Raku's life isn't Claude but rather his dad, seeing as he keeps on putting him these difficult situations. <br />
                    During the next day, a new student is introduced into their class and her name is Marika Tachibana. She receives a standing ovation that quickly stops the moment she starts hugging Raku. Marika explains that Raku is her fiancée and isn't bothered that Raku has a boyfriend, as she believes that she is a much better match for Raku and insults Chitoge in the process. This annoys Chitoge and Tsugumi, the latter who decides to point a gun at Marika which causes a SWAT team charge inside the classroom and surround Marika and Raku. Marika explains that her father is an overprotective chief of police, before feeling 'faint' and needing Raku to escort her to the nurse's office. There she tries to get Raku to agree to a wedding date, to which he tries to get her agree to call it off, but she is too in love with him to do that. Meanwhile everyone except Shu arrives outside the nurse's office to hear a kerfuffle within and when they barge in to intervene, they see Raku on top of Marika and immediately assume that Raku was trying to get it on with Marika (if you know what I mean) and Chitoge clobbers him. <br /> 
                    The chapter ends with Marika washing her face from outside, whilst her attendant, Honda, describes the obstacles in her way to win Raku's heart, to which Marika tells that she is confident that Raku will be hers.

                    The chapter begins with Chitoge feeling remorse for her actions towards Raku from the day before, but before she can apologise, she hides after seeing Marika hug Raku. Marika asks Raku on a date, to which he politely declines initially, but the threat of an angry police chief towards the heir of a yakuza syndicate, is too great of a risk to take so he agrees. <br />
                    The date begins with Raku and Marika meeting up, with Marika being flanked by a police entourage, who are dismissed once Raku arrives. They set off, whilst being tailed by Chitoge, Tsugumi, Onodera and Ruri, all in disguises with some better than others. On the way Raku asks Tsugumi directions to the restaurant they going to, which she gives only to be annoyed that he didn't see through her perfect disguise. At the restaurant, Marika asks why Raku is with a brute of a girlfriend, to which Raku defends Chitoge and follows up that the 2 could be friends, which Marika dismisses due to her dislike of long-haired girls - so that includes herself, right? Marika whisks Raku away to more private location, so no one following them could find, except Chitoge who had lost them earlier due to her disguise being more suspicious than the others. There he asks if she knows anything about the promise he made 10 years ago, to which she will only part with such information if he breaks with girlfriend. <br />
                    There's a bonus comic at the end which is a dream Raku and Onodera share, from Raku's perspective, with the 2 as newly-weds, but Raku's dream ends before it gets good, while Onodera's version goes on a bit longer with the 2 doing something in a bath - hand holding perhaps?
