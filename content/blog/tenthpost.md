    One of the thoughts I've had is that if ever I have a website, I should use it host reviews of the Manga and japanese Light Novels that I have read. <br />
    Well I now have a website and I finished everything with regards to The Coders Guild and have done nothing with it since,  so what's the excuse? So from next Tuesday, I will post Manga reviews of each volume in a series every other week, but if your still a fan of my coding skills I will still evidence them on weeks when I'm not posting Manga reviews. See you Tuesday.
