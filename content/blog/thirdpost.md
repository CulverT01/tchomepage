	As a part of the Coders Guild Bootcamp on for Web Design and Development Skills, I studied and learnt about JavaScript. This post and the next few will demonstrate various key uses of JavaScript. Down below is a program that calculates the cost of the overall bill and from how much it originally cost and the percentage of tip that they will provide.

  </div>
</div>
```js
		let foodCost = prompt('Enter the cost of food:');
		let tipPercent = prompt('Percentage of cost to be tipped:'); 
		var tipAmount = (Number(foodCost) * Number(tipPercent))/ 100;
		var totalBill = Number(foodCost) + tipAmount;
		alert('Total bill is: Â£' + totalBill.toFixed(2));
	```
