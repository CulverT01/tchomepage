                    Continuing on from the cliffhanger from last volume, Kosaki and Raku are given a room at the inn to share for the night and there is no alternative (no spare room, no more buses until tomorrow, etc). Kosaki is okay sharing with Raku, as she trusts he won't do anything nefarious, but they move the futons apart and put down a partition in between them anyway. As all of the guest have finished with the baths, Raku and Kosaki head to the baths only to encounter each other in the bathing area as it a coed bathing area. Raku volunteers to bathe later, but Kosaki is okay with him bathing right now because he is a gentleman and she trusts that he isn't going to do anything 'nefarious' to her. Kosaki starts to talk about the day they have had and how they bathed when they were younger. The reference to when they were younger gets Raku thinking how Kosaki made a promise with a boy, using a key and a pendant as physical mementoes and that boy was her first love which means: Raku is Kosaki's first love - No sh!t Sherlock! Raku asks Kosaki to confirm this, but she has fainted from overheating, so can't answer. Raku never gets his answer as while she does wake up later, neither bring up the question at any point that night or the next day.

                    It is the Sports Festival for Bonyari High and Chitoge, who is on the red team along with Raku and Kosaki, is super excited. Seishiro, Ruri and Marika are on the white team; we don't know which team the other characters are on. Raku notices that Shu and few others huddled in a corner and are acting suspiciously, so goes to investigate. He is given the excuse of a meeting for the Sports Festival executive committee, which he doesn't really buy, but has no other evidence that they are up to no good to interrogate them further. His suspicions are validated when during the 3-legged race, a surprise obstacle in the form of a balloon-hug challenge appears and he and Chitoge, his partner for the race, have to pop the balloon between their bodies. They do and win the event, but not all escape unscathed. Another event that has a last minute change is the bread eating contest, which has had the string that holds the bread replaced with elastic string meaning the bread bounces even more and it comes to the detriment for Kosaki, but the benefit for everyone else watching. Seishiro calls over Raku asking where Chitoge is (preparing for her next event) as well as if it is okay to cheer for her even though she is on a different team. Raku tells her not to take the festival seriously and cheer for whomever she likes, as he and most likely Chitoge will be cheering for anyway when she competes. Seishiro spots Chitoge and waves to her, loosing the wrap around her chest and takes her embarrassment out on Raku. Marika spots Raku and asks if he would like to have lunch together, he refuses but she notices his headband is dirty and hands him a new one that reads 'I Love Marika' so when Chitoge spots him wearing it, she socks him. The next event documented is the scavenger hunt and the 4 known competitors: Marika, Chitoge, Seishiro and Kosaki all receive the same prompt - That Special Someone. All instinctively look at Raku, with Chitoge and Marika fight each other to be the first to reach Raku. Raku agrees to go with Chitoge, owing to the appearances of the Beehive gang and Shuei-Gumi, which is what also fuels Marika's decision to concede. At the end of the event, Raku asks what Seishiro and Kosaki had for their prompt but Shu gets a pocket knife to the forehead and a home-made sandwich to the mouth to silence him.<br/>
                    This chapter felt weird as I felt that some characters (Chitoge and Seishiro) had regressed to the state they were at the early part of the series and any growth they might have had has been lost. Given the event that happens in the chapter this clearly was we have a deadline that we can't meet with any more plot-driven chapter, so this pre-prepared chapter will have to do.

                    Yui is very popular with everyone (including teachers) relying on her for advice on school work, sports, books and love. In the corridor, Raku spots Yui carrying a load of books and volunteers to help and is concerned with how much she is doing but she dismisses his worries.<br/> 
                    Back at home, Raku discovers that Yui has done his laundry as well as buying some treats and more bandages (they are running low) for the members of Shuei-Gumi before receiving a phone call and having to attend to some Char Siu Kai business. As he is relaxing in the bath, Yui tries to enter (her private bath has some plumbing issues) so he shoos her away, only to return with a swimsuit. On the way back to his room, Raku is stopped by Night (Yui's bodyguard) who warns him to pay better attention to Yui, but the hyper-aware Raku doesn't understand.<br/>
                    The next day, Raku has forgotten his maths textbook and returns to the classroom to pick it up only to find clean and spotless, all thanks to Yui. After explaining why he is back at the classroom, Yui suggests that she helps him study and he allows only during the private study session, Yui collapses.
