                    This is my review of Volume 13 of Nisekoi. This volume has the best cover artwork of any of the volumes I reviewed so far and I believe the best of the whole series - I'll let you know if that will change. I think that my opinion is like that because of the vibrant colours used on Haru's Yukata and Ruri's Kimono as well as the 2-colour background, which no other volume uses, makes it stand out even more.<br/> 
                    This will also be my last update for the year, as I am taking time off to visit family over Christmas, so the next post will be 7th January 2025. So, a Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays and a Happy New Year.

                    The chapter continues on from the previous one, with Haru reeling from the revelation that Raku and Chitoge aren't properly dating and explains both Raku's and Kosaki's behaviour towards each other. Haru no longer has an issue with Raku, although I don't understand how the fact that Raku and Chitoge are fake dating justifies Raku's behaviour towards Kosaki, as is it still looks like he is flirting with another girl that isn't his girlfriend. Haru has now resolved to get both Raku and her sister together, to which she absolutely no problem with, so ignore the pang in her heart; it's just probably indigestion. Haru realises that she is lost and can't call anyone as the phone network around festival is overloaded, so wishes for her saviour knight, who arrives in the form of Raku. He had been tasked by Fu to find Haru, but had got lost in the process, so has to spend the rest of the festival with Haru and tries to cheer her up by winning any prize she wants from the Ring Toss stall, with him achieving it on the first try. They go around other stalls, with Raku winning as many prizes as possible for Haru as well as picking up some food that she'll like until he is broke. The fireworks begin to signal the end of the festival and Haru confesses that the time spent with Raku wasn't bad, before asking if he is her 'Prince Charming'.

                     Raku denies that he is Haru's 'Prince Charming' and she moves onto asking why he didn't compliment her earlier in chapter 107, to which his response is that the last time he tried to compliment her back in chapter 94, she whacked him on the head. Haru thinks back to what her sister had said about Raku being a considerate person and realises that she is in love with him. They all eventually meet up with everyone else, except Marika, and enjoy the rest of the festival.<br/> 
                     Later that evening, Haru apologises to Kosaki about how she didn't see the fireworks with Raku, whilst Kosaki is happy that Raku was with Haru and she wasn't alone. Haru then asks how long Raku has had his pendant and Kosaki explains he has had it for a long time and that it is important to him, which allows Haru to connect the dots and work out her 'Prince Charming' is Raku and decides that she will give up on him and focus trying to get her sister and Raku together, but not before having a little cry to mourn for her love for him. Although she still hasn't fully healed the next day, as she tries to shoo Raku away after he comes to their shop to purchase some Dorayaki.

                   Haru invites Raku to visit an aquarium with herself and her sister - much to the disbelief of both. She frames this as a way to make up for the fact that Kosaki and Raku didn't get hang out during the festival. Raku questions Haru intentions, which causes an argument, so Kosaki is determined to make Haru and Raku get along better by spending time together, while Haru wants Raku and Kosaki to be alone together. Before they enter the aquarium, Kosaki and Raku decide to hold Haru's hands to prevent her getting lost. They head to the dolphin enclosure, still holding hands, and during the show, Kosaki leaves 'to get some drinks', so Haru and Raku left behind to mistaken as a couple and roped into participating in the show. When told, they each have to raise a small flag and the dolphin (Ru) will jump and they must perform this whilst holding hands, so when Raku goes for Haru's hand (he'd been holding her wrist) she flinches and raises her flag, giving the signal to Ru to jump, soaking the pair. Kosaki goes to the gift shop to find a spare outfit for Haru, leaving Haru and Raku to enjoy the aquarium together (much to Haru annoyance) and when she returns and begins to talk to Raku, Haru wanders off to look at other exhibits whilst getting lost. When she realises this, she wishes Raku would find her, to which he immediately does, shows off some keychains that are combination of sea creatures and Japanese sweets. She takes the Mitarashi Whale keychain, with intention of disposing of it when she gets home, but decides to keep it instead and ends the chapter determined to get over Raku.

                     Paula and Seishiro find a container filled with gummy sweets within Beehive headquarters. Paula wants to eat some of the sweets, but Seishiro forbids it under the assumption that doing so will inevitably lead to trouble. Paula takes the sweets to school and eats one before spotting Seishiro and rushing over to her and asking her to pet her. Paula is acting like this because the gummy sweets are also a love drug that makes the consumer fall in love with the first person they see, so she is head over heels for Seishiro and there's nothing Seishiro can do to fix this as no remedy is listed, nor is Claude available (please try again at the end of the chapter). Seishiro returns to her desk with Paula clinging on to her and she ends knocking over the container, spilling the sweets. Seishiro tries to tidy them up but Chitoge, Kosaki and Marika all eat one and fall in love with Seishiro and begin to flirt with her, although Marika's love for Raku means she resists the influence of drug. Raku also finds a sweet, but asks Seishiro if he can have, so she takes it from him, but before she can put it away Chitoge lunges at her knocking the sweet into her mouth and she swallows it, so she immediately runs away from Raku. Raku chases her down, thus she has to run away, which she does into a wall and Raku escorts her the nurse's office, assuming her to be sick. Before Raku can leave, Seishiro hugs him and Claude calls to explain that the flaw with love drug is the effects last no more than 10 minutes, which it has been more than since Seishiro ate the gummy.

                    Migisuke, the commander of the police riot squad seen in chapter 71, has come to Marika for advice - love advice. Initially, Marika couldn't care about Migisuke love life, but soon sees it as a opportunity to satisfy her kink - get Raku unintentionally to flirt with her and proclaim his 'love' for her, the sick freak. <br/>
                    They find Raku studying in a library, thanks to tracking device Marika has placed on him, and Marika introduces him as a romantic expert. They begin by having Migisuke ask Marika out on a date, only for him to fail completely, so when Raku demonstrates by beginning to ask Marika out casually, he passes with flying colours (naturally). The move onto physical contact, although they first have to get over Migisuke lack of sex education. Migisuke predictably fails by trying hold Marika's hand, while Raku shows the correct choice by giving Marika a head-pat. The Final lesson on asking a woman out, is to propose to her, which Raku demonstrates by slipping an imaginary ring onto Marika's left hand (words are for amateurs) and Marika collapses with a nosebleed from too much stimulation - told you it was her kink. <br/>
                    Migisuke puts the examples Raku demonstrated into practice on his crush, Honda (Marika's bodyguard), and receives a knee to the face in return.

                    Ruri's Great-Grandpa's final wish before his death, which is likely to be very soon, is to see her boyfriend and he's been 'dying' for a long time, so Ruri pulls a random photo from a class album and reveals that to be her boyfriend, which turns out to be Raku. This is incredibly lucky as Ruri is visiting her Great-Grandpa and has to bring her boyfriend along, so Ruri, Raku and Shu head off to visit him. Shu was with Raku when Ruri explained the situation, she had got him into, so felt like he had to tag along, despite it not involving him. When they arrive at Ruri's Great-Grandpa's estate, he lunges at her, full of vitality and not at all death's door, so Ruri kicks him in self-defence. He introduces himself as Musashi Miyamoto (a famous Japanese swordsman), which Ruri corrects to Yoshizo Miyamoto and shows Raku a photo album of Ruri as a child, with his particular highlight being a photo of Ruri unabashed at the evidence of wetting bed - he receives appropriate retribution. Shu has found a kindred spirit in Yoshizo, so introduces him to his collection of candid shots of Ruri and receives appropriate retribution. Ruri and Raku head to their rooms to relax, with Ruri remarking how difficult it is to pretend to date someone before heading to her room. Raku asks Satonaka, Yoshizo's maid, where the guest room is and is directed to the Camellia room, which is Ruri's room. Ruri is not best pleased at this arrangement (especially when Raku walks in on her changing) that Yoshizo has organised and the chapter ends with Satonaka revealing that Yoshizo really hasn't got that long left.

                    Satonaka further specifies how long Yoshizo has (1 or 2 days), but Ruri doesn't initially believe it, but is eventually convinced and requests some time alone to process it. Later, Raku enters Ruri's room to asks what she wants to do for her Great-Grandpa and pledges his assistance to whatever she has planned. This act of selflessness and kindness is enough to make Ruri fall in love with him, but only a smidge! The next day Ruri wakes up Raku up, who initially doesn't recognise her, but after he does remarks she looks better with her hair down and without her glasses. This natural flirtatious comment is again enough to make Ruri fall in love with Raku, but again only a smidge! Ruri then goes and asks Yoshizo if there is anything he wants from her, so he suggests they go fishing. Ruri is not convinced that this is what he wants, but her Great-Grandpa assures her that it is. They spend the rest of the day busy spending time outside and after her bath that night, she and Yoshizo play video games where he talks about how happy he is that she has found someone who loves and understands her. On the way back to her room, she meets Raku in the corridor, who is looking at some photos of Ruri that hanging up on the wall, which inspires her.

                    Ruri knows what she needs to do to make her Great-Grandpa happy and it requires Shu's photo collection. Ruri and Raku head to Yoshizo's room to apologise for lying about boyfriend and girlfriend as well as showing off a collection of photos starring Ruri and her friends: Kosaki, Chitoge, Seishiro, and Marika. She explains who they are and what they are like, also that she isn't ready to be dating yet, but there is nothing for him to worry about as she'll be just fine. Before Shu, Raku and Ruri head home, everyone takes a photo together, with Ruri all dressed up. As they leave, Yoshizo begins coughing and falls to the ground and Ruri dashes over, only for him to reveal it to be a prank and swift justice is dealt.<br/>

                    The gang are studying in a library and decide to take a break for lunch and Marika has lovingly prepared herself a feast for Raku, which is really delicious. This frustrates Chitoge and Marika's taunting on how she is a terrible cook doesn't help matters, so the 2 agree to have a cook off, with Raku being the judge. The next day, Chitoge serves some Ginger Pork, but it ends up coming out as sludge and knocks Raku out, who has to be revived with Marika's tasty, freshy-squeezed fruit juice - Round 1 to Marika. Round 2, Chitoge has prepared Raku a sandwich (following a recipe as she didn't last time), but again it is just bubbling sludge and still knocks Raku out. The next day Chitoge provides him an omelette ... in a shape of a cube and it isn't edible, so Marika taunts Chitoge by freshly preparing sushi with love as a key ingredient. Chitoge goes home to try again and this time has some high-quality ingredients, but someone had left the door of the fridge they were stored in and now they have all spoiled. Chitoge only rice left available, which inspires to make some Onigiri. They come out a little misshapen, but taste amazing, thanks to her thinking about Raku while she made them.<br/>
