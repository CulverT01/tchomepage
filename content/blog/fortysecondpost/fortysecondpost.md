                    This is my review of Volume 19 of Nisekoi. A spot of slight coincidence, as this review was published on 25th March and some of the events of this volume take place around Christmas, which for most is 25th December.

                    Raku readies himself to take on Claude, but before he can even get close, Adelt appears to stop the fighting as Beehive is not leaving Japan. This is because everyone else in Beehive has signed a petition and swore an oath to stay behind in Japan and not to pick fights with Shuei-Gumi any more. The reason for this is because they heard Chitoge crying and locked up, they couldn’t torture her like that. Claude objects, but Adelt knows of the extreme measures he taken recently, so his complaints fall on deaf hears and he can expect punishment as well.<br/>
                    Raku, Seishiro and Chitoge all head to the party and share the good news and everyone gets emotional, especially Paula who also no longer has to move, although Marika shows the minimum emotion to be courteous.<br/>
                    After the party, Raku and Chitoge take a walk where Chitoge thanks Raku for doing what he did and asks why he did it. Raku tells her that Shu asked how he feels about Chitoge and while he wasn’t sure what she was to him, based on his recent reactions and decisions, Chitoge is without a doubt: one of his best friends. Adelt then calls Chitoge to let her know that she will be staying at Shuei-Gumi’s house, per her plan to stay in Japan.

                    Chitoge’s stay at Raku’s house will be for only one day as the Beehive gang make their house habitable again, besides it will be good practice for when she gets married - is she marrying Raku in her future? The 2 are still slightly awkward after last night’s confession, but they put that to the side. Raku assumes they can just simply chill out, but Chitoge disagrees as she needs spend the day learning to do housework to prepare for marriage - housework isn’t just for women, it is for all who wish to live independently. Raku is convinced she will be a hindrance and tells her so, Chitoge sets out to prove him wrong, however she puts too much detergent powder (an entire box’s worth) in to the washing machine and gets soap suds all over her. To make up for this, she decides to clean the house, but ends leaving room far more messier than they were as she tried to reorganise the cupboards and drawers but not everything would fit back in, thus she left things out. Determined to succeed, Chitoge declares she’ll cook dinner, which Raku objects to and so compromise is found where he assists her in cooking. The food predictably comes looking burnt, but is actually tasty. The 2 share a room to sleep in (Chitoge is okay with it, Raku less so) and talk about how everything is back to normal along with if they are willing to continue the current arrangement, although the conversation is cut short when Yui sleepwalks into the room.<br/>
                    Meanwhile Kosaki is looking for a CD in Haru’s room (don’t worry she has permission) and finds some pages from a book drawn in the same art style as the book of the fairytale about the prince, princess and a pendant.

                    Kosaki works out that the pages from the picture book that Raku remembered when he had amnesia (Chapters 87-91). The reason why Haru has the pages is that they fell out whilst she was reading them, so hid them out of shame. Also she asks if Kosaki is definitely free tomorrow. After escorting Chitoge home (or part-way as her mother calls her to spend time with her as it is Christmas Eve and she is free), Raku is contacted by Haru. The next day, Raku arrives at Kosaki's house and is greeted by Haru who tells him to wait in her room. There he spots the picture book along with the loose pages and picks it up as Kosaki enters the room. Kosaki reveals she plans on telling everyone tomorrow, but seeing as Raku is here, we find out what is on those pages. <br/>
                    The pages detail the prince arriving at the castle of his lover, the princess, only to find it on fire. The princess dies in the fire from smoke inhalation and the prince weeps for her before saying "Zawsze in Love", placing the pendant in one of her hands and opening it with a key. Inside the pendant are 2 rings which have the prince and the princess's names on them. The final page, that we know of, there was some writing done by presumed 5 year-old Raku. <br/>
                    The existence of the book and these pages are more evidence to suggest that Kosaki is Raku's pendant girl, but Raku wants something more concrete: a memento that signifies that it was definitely him and Kosaki making that promise, such as a photo or something with the names engraved - rings inside the pendant? Haru enters the room with a request for Raku: go on a date with Kosaki.

                    Haru explains that there is a special limited edition plushie that is given out at fir tree in a shopping centre a few train stations away to couples and she isn’t free to get it, but Raku and Kosaki are. They arrive at the shopping centre and meander towards the fir tree whilst talking about how good it is that Chitoge is staying in Japan as well as who should really take credit for making that happen. They arrive at the fir tree and find when the plushies are given out: when they light up the tree for 5 minutes at 8pm this evening. Also, the fir tree is legendary as couples who witness it being lit up are fated to live happily ever after. They decide to sit down in the food court to work out what to do whilst waiting for the tree to light up and Raku notices there’s a locksmith in the centre, so suggests that they visit to see it can be opened with Kosaki’s key. Kosaki agrees, so they visit the locksmith, explain the situation to him and tells them to leave with him and he’ll sort it out by the end of the day. They leave the locksmith resolving to confess their feelings if there is anything inside which proves that they made the promise together.<br/>
                    Meanwhile, the pendant and key falls from a workbench and into a waste bin and only the locksmith’s granddaughter notices.

                   Raku and Kosaki are unsure where to go, as Chitoge leads the dates that she and Raku go on and Kosaki has never been on one. Raku suggests they go to the cinema and they see an animal movie called Meowsville Goes to New York. Neither pay attention to the movie and instead spend their time stealing glances at each other, so the post-movie conversation goes nowhere. Unsure what to do next, Raku asks what Kosaki usually does and her response is that she tends to visit gift shops and furniture shops when at shopping centres. They start at a gift shop where they try on some glasses. Kosaki makes Raku swoon with her choice, while Raku makes Kosaki laugh with his. Then they move to a furniture shop where Kosaki is enamoured with the softness of a bed so the 2 lay on it to really test it out. They go to some other shops, mostly an arcade, before Kosaki realises it 7pm and they have an hour before the fir tree lights up. Raku wants to get Kosaki a present, so asks to split up to do so and arranges for them to meet at the fir tree for 8pm.<br/>
                   Whilst buying Kosaki’s present, Raku tries to contact the locksmith, but notices his phone’s battery is dead (again), so wanders to the locksmith (it’s nearby) only to be waved down by the locksmith. He explains that he has lost the pendant and key and they are mostly like in the rubbish which is collected at 8pm from a central collection point. He has also contacted Kosaki.

                   The locksmith hands Raku a map of the central rubbish area and he runs towards it, but gets a feeling that Kosaki isn’t going to be there. He has a mental conflict on whether the promise to the girl he made with the pendant 11 years ago (his first love) is any more important to the promise he made today to Kosaki (the girl he loves today). Kosaki is also going through similar mental anguish, but she isn’t the main character so her problems are secondary.<br/>
                   Raku arrives at the fir tree before 8pm and can’t see Kosaki, but then she appears behind him.

                    Both Raku and Kosaki are surprised by seeing each other and Kosaki explains that they promised to meet at the tree, while Raku’s explanation is a confession of love although the lighting of the tree robs him of the moment. They get the plushie and then locksmith calls to tell them that his granddaughter had the key and pendant and her parents have returned them to the locksmith. They begin to head off, but Kosaki grabs Raku’s sleeve to not lose him (his phone doesn’t work right now, remember) so he grabs her hand and leads her to the locksmith. Kosaki is incredibly happy that she and Raku held hands, it shows on her face even when she gets home. She then asks Haru if there are any more pages, but she says that there isn’t. Their mum walks in, so Kosaki asks her about the book, but all their mum can tell them is that someone gave them that book and she can’t remember their name.<br/>
                    All this information is relayed to the others at school along with the results of the locksmith’s investigation: he can’t open it without forcing it, which he was specifically prohibited from doing so - looks like we back to square one! Marika notices how chummy Kosaki and Raku are and doesn’t like one bit.

                    Raku wakes up to find himself on a tropical island as Marika his kidnapped him by using a police unit to pick him up whilst he was still sleeping (his father okayed the operation). Marika explains that they are on a private island that the Tachibana's own in Kiribati (pronounced Ki-Ri-Bas) to see the first sunrise of the year as Kiribati is so far east that it is technically west. Raku is stuck here until tomorrow, so makes peace with situation as he believes only a jerk would constantly complain if taken to a resort, but don't take it as that he is happy with the situation. Marika takes him to the main residence on the island and asks what he wants to do which is homework. He wants to finish it and will only do the activities Marika wants, once it is done. By the way, Marika hasn't started her homework yet. Marika tries to negotiate with Raku, asking him if she does well on the homework he will rub sun oil and Raku agrees if she solves a maths problem he presents her. Marika solves the problem as someone told she needed better grades to study at the same university as Raku. Marika leaves to get some drinks before Honda appears and properly introduces herself to Raku. She asks how Raku feels about Marika, as a woman, which he gives a diplomatic answer to. She then tells him that if loves Marika, he should confess soon as she doesn't have much time left.

                    Raku and Marika are rowing to a nearby uninhabited island when their boat sinks and only themselves, a fishing gear set and a bottle of water survive the sinking. Marika swears that this wasn't part of her plan, but they are no stuck on island until someone realises they're missing and tries to find them. Raku makes a set of shoes for Marika from leaves and hands her the bottle of water as they set out to find food and water. Luckily, this island has a small water source, which Marika discovers, as well as being a home for breadfruit, which Marika also discovers. Their evening meal consists of fried breadfruit and sashimi, using the local fish. Raku thanks Marika for staying calm when they got stranded and notices that they have run out of water, so Marika volunteers to get some more. However on her way to the source, her weak constitution catches up to her and she collapses.<br/>
