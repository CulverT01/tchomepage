                    This is my review of the Nisekoi Volume 3. The last one had alot less humor than the first, due to the lack of Shuei-Gumi members appearing in the volume, although Ruri did her upmost best trying to compensate for that. Hopefully this one will have more humor to it.

                    The chapter continues on from the revelation at the last volume that Seishiro Tsugumi is a girl. Raku realises the awkward situation he is in and immediately tries to rectify that by trying to dress Tsugumi before hiding the 2 of them in a locker as the entire class comes looking for them. Whilst they don't 'appear' to be in the locker room, the class continues to search as there is water on the floor. Tsugumi begins to open up to Raku as to why she dresses like she does and why she has a boy's name. Basically, Claude thought she was a boy, brought her as such and never changed his mind in the subsequent time since. Meanwhile, Raku is trying to keep his feelings in check, as he is in a tight space with a semi-naked girl who is incredibly cute and he tells her such as Chitoge finds them. Chitoge clobbers Raku, before he explains himself and if he had done before she did, then she would've stopped also Raku's misery doesn't end there as he has to write a letter of apology to the school for using the without permission. After he leaves, Tsugumi confesses Chitoge that Raku won and that she understands what he said about her, but still doesn't approve of him - is a tsundere attitude a part of the female Beehive culture or something? Chitoge gets Tsugumi to wear the female student uniform as a way of showing that she's a girl along with a ribbon in her hair, which Raku says looks super cute and immediately flusters her, so she changes back to her old uniform but still continues to wear the ribbon.<br /> There's an intermission for this chapter at the end which details the different outfits Tsugumi had to try on before settling for the school uniform and they get more revealing every time.

                    Tsugumi formally introduces herself to Onodera and Ruri to which Ruri reveals that she knew all along that Tsugumi is a girl, whilst showing immediate displeasure towards Shu as his addressing of Chitoge is far too rude for someone of his standing. She continues to hang around Chitoge, meaning Raku can't get too close to her - not that he minds. The club that Raku and Chitoge are a part of need to pick up some food for the animals because they have some rare animals that you can't just simply order in the food for, but your nearest pet store will stock such food. Tsugumi volunteers to go in Chitoge stead, but only after Chitoge puts her in a dress and takes her weapons away in order to make her more girlier, thus no one will mistake for a girl. The outfit that Chitoge picked out is so spellbounding that everyone, including Raku, ends up staring, much to Tsugmui's embarassment. On their way to the pet store, Tsugumi stumbles and Raku catches her, where it's revealed that Tsugumi's heels are her causing so much discomfort that it's easier for Raku to carry her rather than let her suffer. The 2 end up talking about crushes and seeing as neither have one, they discuss Chitoge instead whose first crush was a boy she met 10 years ago. Raku tells Tsugumi that alot of guys will crush on her due to her ability of total devotion, which really embarasses her.
