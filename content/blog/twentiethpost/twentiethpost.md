    Hello and welcome to the fourth update to the Card Game Player Project.<br />
    This week I've been finishing changing the Support Card classes' effect method to boolean as well as making skill an attribute of Card rather than Creature Card. The next thing to make is the Runner class, so finally we can play a game of Castles of Cards. This means the methods to start and play a game as well as to play the 4 stages of a turn (one for each stage).<br />
    As always, the entire project is available at this GitHub repository: <a href="https://github.com/CulverT01/cardgameplayer">https://github.com/CulverT01/cardgameplayer</a>

    <h2 class="row">Updates</h2>
    <p class="col-8"> 
    All Support Card classes' effect method is now boolean, so the effect can fail and the card not be wasted. Player's playCardFromHand method has also changed to reflect this change and now only sends a Support Card to the wasteland if the effect method returns true boolean value. There is also new methods for KeyFunction class, which checks the wasteland or deck to see if there is a possible target to select within that array. The examples shown below are the updated SupportCardResMa class and its test as well as the checkWasteland and checkDeck methods of KeyFunction.

    <h2 class="row">Changes and Clarifications</h2>
    <p class="col-8">
    Examples regarding the changes to the effect method, is  with the SupportCardResMa and SupportCardResMe classes, the effect fails if there isn't a free space on a player's frontline to play it to and before it would run as normal, except the Creature selected would stay in the wasteland and the Support Card would still go to the wasteland as per Player's playCardFromHand method. All Support Cards that increase a stat (a Creature's Attack or Health, a Player's Defence Points) can only return true boolean value as the checks that would fail them have already passed in the playCardFromHand behaviour (is there a Magic/Melee Creature in your frontline) of Player.
