                    This is my review of Volume 21 of Nisekoi and this one is going to be Marika-focussed volume, which should see Raku finally set the record straight with Marika about how he feels about her. Also this volume has the last chapter of Magical Confectioner Kosaki.

                    It is Valentine's day Raku has received chocolate from all the women in his life except 1: Marika Tachibana. Marika is absent today, so Chitoge suggests visiting her to see how she is doing, so she and Raku make plans to head to her home after school (Kosaki is working today). On their way out of school, Marika greets them by the school entrance as while she is sick, she is "well enough" to give Raku something important. Marika escorts them to her home and on the way, gets a phone call from her mother which she quickly ignores. Marika then explains that she hates her mother and describes her as a monster, so wishes not to communicate with her. Later on the walk, Chitoge notices the she has left her school bag at school and rushes back to get it, leaving Raku and Marika alone so she can hand him her Valentine's chocolate: a chocolate engagement ring which can be worn (it won't melt and it fits his finger) as well as be accepted as a token of her love. Raku begins to brush off the confession, but then realises he is avoiding the issue again, and begins to properly confess the truth. Marika interrupts him to reveal that she knows that he is secretly in love with Kosaki, his and Chitoge's relationship is fake, and she ready to accept any answer he gives.

                    Marika makes desperate plea to Raku to accept her feelings, but before he can tell her the truth, she collapses on the ground whilst burning up. Honda suddenly appears and carries Marika away, bounding and gagging her to prevent her running off, as well as telling Raku that he should forget about Marika. <br/>
                    The next day, Yui announces to the class that Marika has changed schools yesterday and has returned home to Kyushu. Raku tries to call Marika (in class) and can't reach her. The next day, the gang all meet up on the school roof and discuss what they can find out about Marika's transfer. They have nothing, as there is almost no documents confirming her being in Bonyari. Chitoge mentions heading to Kyushu to find her, which inspires Raku to call someone.

                    The person Raku calls is Mikage who explains that Marika has switched schools as she and her mother made a deal that she could go to Bonyari to try to get Raku to marry her, but if Marika got too sick (in Honda's opinion) or she could win Raku's love before that then: she must come home, marry a man of Marika's mother's choosing, and never go against her ever again. In case you didn't know (which you shouldn't this is the first time this being revealed), Marika's family has been around since the time of the Samurai and is run as a grand matriarchy, so her mother is the head of the family and what she says goes. Mikage reveals more about the relationship between Marika and her mother which boils down to Marika's mother viewing Marika as nothing more than a tool to continue the lineage. Mikage reveals the that Marika's groom-to-be is a divorced steel magnate in his 40s and they are to be wedded tomorrow. Raku is hesitant at what to do, as he wants to save her from this marriage but still has to reject her, so Chitoge snaps him back to reality and he decides to try and rescue Marika with everyone else coming along. The first hurdle is actually getting to Kyushu, but luckily Yui (who has been listening in) has sorted out plane tickets for all of them (except herself) and will stay behind to smooth things over back in Bonyari.

                    The gang set off for Kyushu, while Mikage internally regrets not telling them 'the most important part'. Meanwhile, while waiting for her mother, Marika tries to run away but Honda catches and restrains her before she can get far. Marika meets her mother (who is hidden in the shadows) and asks for her weeding to be in the western tradition as well as letting her return to Bonyari and to leave her alone forever. Her mother agrees to the first demand, but refuses to agree to the second part - they made a deal and Marika lost, it is only fair.<br/>
                    The gang arrive at Marika's home and Raku immediately tries the intercom, but is refused entry. Chitoge notices that a window is broken and has an idea. Meanwhile, Mikage has come to visit Marika and notices the dire state she is in. She remarks that if Marika is so sad, then she must have really enjoyed it and Marika agrees as she was with Raku. Mikage asks about the others which prompts Marika to say good things about the other, but doesn't say anything about Chitoge. Mikage asks she wants to see them again nad Marika does, but knows that she can't as there is no way that they would know where she is. Suddenly, a loud shout calling for Marika is heard.

                    Marika dashes to her window and spots her friends outside and immediately tries to go and see them, but is stopped by Honda as her mother has forbidden her from seeing her friends from Bonyari (friends from Kyushu are a-okay, I mean it is not like they are going to collude with those from Bonyari are they?). As the gang are chased away by some guards, Marika chastises Mikage for her actions who remains convinced that this is what Marika wants. Mikage quickly leaves and meets up with the gang nad finds out their reason for visiting and introduces them to a secret passage that will get them into the house. Raku, Chitoge and Seishiro (the main characters and the one with any combat expertise) head through while the rest stay behind (don't worry, Mikage has a use for them). The three finally arrive inside the house and are met by Honda. Raku pleads with her to help Marika, but Honda ignores this as her loyalty lies with the Tachibana family and its grand matriarch - Marika' mother, Chika Tachibana.<i> Now, Beehive could easily moved out of Japan if they had trained Seishiro like this.</i> Also Honda may be employed by the police force in Bonyari, but her primary job since birth has been a secret bodyguard, as her family specialises in intelligence gathering, monitoring, sabotage, other undercover work, etc. This means that Honda is basically a ninja. Undeterred by this revelation, Seishiro is willing to fight Hondo, to allow Chitoge and Raku to find Chika and talk some sense into her - good luck to all.
