                    This is my review of the Nisekoi Volume 2. The chapters now are lot shorter and so the summaries will be smaller, as one of my personal criticisms with the last review was about how long some of those summaries ended up being.

                    The plot of the chapter is about a group study session at Raku's home, that is organised by Ruri Miyamoto (Onodera's friend who appeared in Volume 1, but). She has done this so Onodera has a chance to get close to the boy she loves: Raku Ichijo. However, Onodera isn't willing to flirt with a man that is spoken for, so she is tense around him and avoids his gaze. Ruri tries to get Raku to help Onodera with her homework, but Chitoge intercepts and helps instead, which annoys Raku but pleases her. Chitoge asks Onodera if she likes anyone, which she denies, and Citoge responds with a similar before backtracking because she has someone - Raku. Shu begins to tease the couple, but before he can do any damage, Raku pulls him away to set the record straight about him and Chitoge. Shu reveals he worked out about their fake relationship from the start and was just messing with him. He then asks if Raku's going to confess his feelings to Onodera, after all she has a crush on him. <br /> 
                    The Shuei-Gumi members continue to be the best source of comedy in this series with their welcome sign for Raku and his friends being the comedic highlight of the chapter.

                    The chapter continues on from the previous one with Raku and Shu arguing over whether or not Onodrea has a crush on Raku, with the result being probably not. They return to the group before Shuei-Gumi members try to help further Raku's relationship with Chitoge by locking both of them in a storeroom. This mildly inconviences Raku but Chitoge is petrified, so he promises not leave her side, despite her tsundere protestations. In order to past the time he suggests talking and the first topic is Onodera. Raku praises Onodera a bit too much, but Chitoge is too dense to realise that he could be in love with her. The next topic is kissing, which inevitably leads to an argument in which Chitoge realises that she's no longer scared and attempts to get up only to fall on top of Raku. Luckily, they are saved by Claude opening the storeroom door, but leads to an awkard situation that sees Onodera run away, embarassed at what they could've been doing, and Claude, mad at what they could've been doing.

                    The chapter follows Chitoge and Raku's date of which both are moaning about that their first date is with the other. Chitoge decides to leave only to spot a member of Shuei-Gumi and she and Raku realise that can't get out of this date. Chitoge demands that Raku takes the lead, as he is a man, so he brainstorms on what he would do on a date with Onodera (his crush, remember) and uses this as his plan for the date. Naturally, Chitoge acts the complete opposite to his fantasy with the date activities culminating in her kicking him after he tried to hold her hand. Raku tries to defend his actions, but Chitoge dismisses his defence and another war of words begin finishing with her ordering him to get her a drink. <br />
                    After he leaves, a group of guys appear and start to hit on her, but she tells them that she waiting for someone and begins to ignore them. Unfortunately, as those guys didn't hear no, they continue to hit on her so she decides to hit on them, physically. Before she can do this, Raku arrives drags her away to a park, before chastising her for not being selective with her battles. Some more arguing occurs and Chitoge leaves for the toilet and while she's away, Raku wishes out loud that he wanted to be on a date with Onodera, when speak of the devil, Onodera appears.

                    The chapter continues where 3 finished off but instead on focussing on Raku's and Onodera's conversation, it instead focusses on Chitoge leaving the toilet and overhearing members of Beehive questioning hers and Raku's love. To remedy this, she decides to turn up the lovey-dovey, not realising that Onodera is there and now has to continue the act in front of a classmate. Raku however, decides to deny all possiblility of them being in a romantic relationship which annoys Chitoge, so she storms off. Onodera tells Raku that he shouldn't deny his and Chitoge's love, but before Raku goes after Chitoge he asks if she's seen his pendant before, preferably when she was younger, to which she denies. <br />
                    This means without a doubt Onodera cannot be Raku's pendant girl even though she has an old key that would probably fit inside the lock on his pendant. Raku finally catches up with Chitoge and apologises along with a gift of Dorayaki. Dorayaki are japanese confection that takes 2 small pancakes made from castella, squishes them together and has a sweet azuki bean paste filling. The chapter ends with Onodera arriving home where it's revealed that she lied to Raku, so she could be his pendant girl but can't tell him for obvious reasons that are obvious. At the back of the chapter are two 4-panel manga strips; the funniest being about the names Raku has given to some of the animals he takes care of.

                    The chapter begins with a scene between a young Raku and his mystery pendant girl in which he changes the ending to a book she's reading from a sad one to a happy one, but before she can say her name, Raku wakes up to reveal it was a dream. He's still upset over the events that happened in chapter 4, specifically those relating to Onodera, and on his way to school he meets up with Chitoge, who looks drained because members of Beehive wouldn't stop asking her about the date. They now both share a mutual exhaustion to the whole situation and are least thankful that only Onodera knows and Raku can set her straight anyway, so they don't have to keep up the charade at school.<br /> 
                    However, it turns out that Onodera wasn't the only one who spotted them out on their date, as Itano and Jogasaki (2 of their classmates) also spotted them and has told the entire class and now Raku and Chitoge are being lauded as a happy couple. Raku tries to deny this but before he has chance to, he spots Claude and realises that they can't deny their relationship as it would jeopardise the peace that their relationship provides. The day passes by and Raku doen't get to talk to Onodera at all due to Claude constantly watching him in order to catch him being unfaithful to Chitoge, but luckily he does catch her at the end of the day after her student government meeting as the school is autonomous and independent from Japan to need its own government. He attempts to set the record straight, but decides against it because the truth could be construed as an admission of love, which he isn't ready to admit to her, so instead he plays down the compatibility between him and Chitoge which she rightly chastises him for because, in her eyes, it is obvious why Chitoge loves him. <br />
                    The chapter ends with someone bumping into Onodera, who then drops an old key. The back of the chapter has 2 more 4-panel manga strips, which follow on from the ones seen at the end of chapter 4. The funniest being Chitoge trying to give some of the animals names.

                    The chapter picks up from the cliffhanger of last chapter, with Onodera frantically trying to explaining to the old key before immediately running away. Raku buys her excuses because, as previously established, she's not her pendant girl. The chapter continues onto a new day in which Chitoge and Raku are exhausted from keeping up their act and Raku suggests that she tells a close friend to lessen the pressure, to which she storms off angrily. Raku is annoyed by her reaction and vents to his close friend, Shu, about this and he responds by mentioning that she may not have any close friends as Raku is the only one she has actually spent time with. <br />
                    Raku goes to find Onodera to set the record straight about his and Chitoge's relationship, only to find that she's gone home. Dejected, he plans to head home only to hear some students talking about Chitoge and how hard it is to approach her, so he changes his mind and finds her instead. When he finds her, he catches her writing notes in a book about her fellow students' interests. She's embarrassed about it, but it is necessary due to Cluade's overprotectiveness and this confession causes Raku to realise how similar their upbringing has been and he confesses he did the same thing before and volunteers to help her with her notes, which much to her chagrin, she accepts. The conversation ends, as usual, in an argument which the admit that their relationship is a lie and this overheard by Onodera.

                    The final chapter focusses on a cooking lesson that the characters are having. Chitoge is stoked, as she believes that the cake she bakes will wow the class and everyone will want to be her friend. However, Raku is unconvinced of her cooking skills (which is proven in the bonus comic at the end of the chapter) and they bicker about it. It is revealed that all of the girls are giving cakes to guys they like which means Raku is immediately interested who Onodera is giving her cake to.
